`AutoTrain` is a tool designed to streamline the process of training Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing a user-friendly command-line interface that encapsulates complex training procedures into simple commands and parameters. It offers users the ability to customize various aspects of the training process, including data preparation, model architecture selection, training strategies, optimization techniques, and deployment options.

The tool is built with flexibility in mind, allowing for the easy adjustment of parameters such as learning rate, batch size, model architecture, and training epochs. It also supports advanced features like Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), mixed precision training, and model quantization to enhance training efficiency, model performance, and deployment readiness.

`AutoTrain` aims to democratize access to state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, making it easier for developers, data scientists, and researchers to train and deploy powerful language models without needing deep expertise in the underlying algorithms or hardware configurations. Its integration with platforms like Hugging Face Hub facilitates model sharing and collaboration, further enhancing its utility in the AI community.

### General Parameters
- **`--text_column` / `--text-column`**: Specifies the name of the column in your dataset that contains the text you want to train your model on. This is crucial for the model to know which data it should learn from.
- **`--rejected_text_column` / `--rejected-text-column`**: Identifies a column in the dataset that contains text data which should not be used for training, allowing for finer control over the training data quality.
- **`--prompt-text-column`**: Designates the column used for input prompts in a conversational or task-oriented setting, enabling the model to learn from a question-answer or prompt-response format.
- **`--model-ref`**: Allows specifying a pre-existing model reference for Differential Privacy Optimization (DPO) techniques when not employing Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT).

### Training Configuration
- **`--warmup_ratio` / `--warmup-ratio`**: Sets the proportion of training to increase the learning rate linearly from 0 to the specified learning rate, helping in stabilizing the model's training early on.
- **`--optimizer`**: Chooses the optimization algorithm (like AdamW, SGD, etc.) to minimize the model's loss function.
- **`--scheduler`**: Specifies the policy for adjusting the learning rate across training epochs (e.g., linear decay, cosine annealing).
- **`--weight_decay` / `--weight-decay`**: Implements regularization by adding a penalty on the size of the weights, preventing overfitting by discouraging large weights.
- **`--max_grad_norm` / `--max-grad-norm`**: Limits the maximum norm of the gradient, preventing the "exploding gradient" problem by clipping the gradients to this value.
- **`--add_eos_token` / `--add-eos-token`**: Adds an End Of Sentence (EOS) token to each text entry, signaling the end of a text segment to the model.
- **`--block_size` / `--block-size`**: Defines the maximum length of the input sequences. If the sequences are longer, they will be truncated to this length.

### Advanced Training Techniques
- **`--peft` / `--use-peft`**: Enables Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning, a method allowing for efficient model adaptation with minimal changes to the model's parameters.
- **`--lora_r` / `--lora-r`**, **`--lora_alpha` / `--lora-alpha`**, **`--lora_dropout` / `--lora-dropout`**: These parameters are specific to LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a technique that introduces trainable low-rank matrices to adapt large pre-trained models with minimal extra parameters. `r` controls the rank of the adaptation, `alpha` adjusts the scaling, and `dropout` provides regularization.
- **`--logging_steps` / `--logging-steps`**: Sets how often to log training metrics, helping monitor the model's performance during training.
- **`--evaluation_strategy` / `--evaluation-strategy`**: Determines when and how the model is evaluated against the validation set, guiding training adjustments.

### Model Saving and Evaluation
- **`--save_total_limit` / `--save-total-limit`**: Limits the total number of model checkpoints saved, managing disk space effectively.
- **`--save_strategy` / `--save-strategy`**: Configures the strategy for saving model checkpoints (e.g., at every epoch, after improvements).

### Performance Optimization
- **`--auto_find_batch_size` / `--auto-find-batch-size`**: Automatically determines the optimal batch size that fits in memory, simplifying the training setup.
- **`--mixed-precision`**: Utilizes mixed precision training (using both float16 and float32) to speed up computations and reduce memory usage without significantly impacting model accuracy.
- **`--quantization`**: Applies model quantization techniques (int4, int8) to reduce model size and inference time, with a potential trade-off in accuracy.
- **`--model_max_length` / `--max-len` / `--max-length`**: Sets the maximum sequence length the model can handle. This is crucial for controlling memory usage and ensuring compatibility with the model's architecture.

### Deployment and Use
- **`--train`**, **`--deploy`**, **`--inference`**: These flags control the mode of operation: training the model, deploying it for use, or running inference to generate predictions.
- **`--username`**: Your Hugging Face Hub username, required for operations involving the Hugging Face Hub, such as pushing trained models.
- **`--backend`**: Specifies the backend infrastructure

 (default or spaces) for deploying or using models, with 'spaces' requiring additional setup like `--repo-id`.
- **`--token`**: Your Hugging Face Hub token, used for authentication to push models to the Hub or access private models/repos.
- **`--repo-id`**: The repository ID on Hugging Face Hub where the model will be stored or from which it will be retrieved.
- **`--push-to-hub`**: Enables automatic pushing of the trained model to the Hugging Face Hub, facilitating sharing and deployment.
- **`--model`**: The base model or architecture you're starting with for training. This could be a pre-trained model or a specific architecture template.
- **`--project-name`**: The name of the project, which could be used as the output directory for training artifacts or as the repository name when pushing to the Hugging Face Hub.

### Experiment Management
- **`--seed`**: Sets a random seed for reproducibility of training results.
- **`--epochs`**: The number of complete passes through the training dataset.
- **`--gradient-accumulation`**: The number of steps to accumulate gradients before performing a backward/update pass, a technique used to effectively increase the batch size.
- **`--disable_gradient_checkpointing` / `--disable-gradient-checkpointing` / `--disable-gc`**: Disables gradient checkpointing, a memory optimization that trades compute for lower memory usage.
- **`--lr`**: The learning rate for the optimizer, determining the size of steps taken during optimization.
- **`--log`**: Enables logging of experiments, possibly to a platform like WandB or TensorBoard for monitoring training metrics.
- **`--data-path`**: The path to the dataset used for training.
- **`--train-split`**, **`--valid-split`**: Specifies the proportions of the dataset to be used for training and validation, guiding the model's ability to generalize.
