Introduction

Cheese is a highly nutritious and palatable food. It is of value in
the diet because it contains in concentrated form almost all the protein and
usually most of the fat, as well as essential minerals, vitamins, and other
nutrients, of milk.

Cheese is made wherever animals are milked and produce more milk
than the people use in ﬂuid form. Most cheese is made from cow's milk,
simply because cows are milked more generally throughout the world than
other animals. Smaller quantities are made from the milk of goats and
ewes. Cheese is also made in some countries from the milk of other animals,
such as camels, asses, mares, buValoes, and reindeer.

People all over the world like and eat cheese. People in the United
States are no exception. Although we do not eat nearly so much cheese
per capita in the United States as do people in some countries, we eat nearly
twice as much now as 20 years ago, or about 10 pounds (all kinds) per capita
per year. This increased consumption is the result, at least in part, of
improvements made in recent years in the quality and uniformity of many
kinds of cheese.","human:What information is available about Washington, D. G. Issued December 1953?

"What information is available about No one knows who made the ﬁrst cheese, but according to an ancient?","legend it was made accidentally by an Arabian merchant. The merchant
put his supply of milk into a pouch made of a sheep's stomach when he
set out on a long day's journey across the desert. The rennet in the lining
of the pouch combined with the heat of the sun caused the milk to separate
into curd and whey. He found at nightfall that the whey satisﬁed his
thirst and the cheese (curd) satisﬁed his hunger and had a delightful
ﬂavor. Thus, according to the legend, the making of one of our most
useful foods was begun.

According to ancient records, cheese was used as a food more than
4,000 years ago. It was made and eaten in Biblical times. Travelers
from Asia are believed to have brought the art of cheesemaking to Europe.
Cheese was made in many parts of the Roman Empire when it was at its
height. Then cheesemaking was introduced to England by the Romans.
During the Middle Ages— from the decline of the Roman Empire until the
discovery of America— as well as later, cheese was made and improved by
the monks in the monasteries of Europe. Gorgonzola was made in the
Po Valley in Italy in 879 A. D. and Italy became the cheesemaking center
of Europe in the 10th century. Roquefort was mentioned in the ancient
records of the monastery at Conques, France, in 1070. The Pilgrims
included cheese in the ship's supplies when they made their famous voyage
to America in the Mayﬂower in 1620.

Until the middle of the 19th century, however, cheesemaking was a local
farm industry. Housewives made cheese from the surplus milk produced

on the farm. In 1851 the ﬁrst cheese factory in the United States was
built by Jesse Williams near Rome, Oneida County, N. Y. Herkimer
County, which adjoins Oneida County, was the center of the cheese industry in the United States for the next 50 years. For many years during
this period the largest cheese market in the world was at Little Falls, N. Y. ;
there cheese from about 200 factories was sold, in addition to farmmade
cheese. As the population increased in the East, and there was a corresponding increase in the demand for market milk, the industry gradually
moved westward, centering in the rich farm lands of Wisconsin. Cheesemaking in the United States and in the other leading cheese-producing
countries of the world is now largely a factory industry, only small amounts
being made on farms for home use.

More than a billion pounds of cheese is now made in the United States
each year. About one-tenth of the annual milk production is used in
making this cheese.

Most cheese is ""natural"" cheese, that is, it is made directly from milk
(or whey, in a few instances) as opposed to ""process"" cheese, which is
made from a blend or combination of one or more kinds of natural cheese.
Natural cheese is made by coagulating or curdling milk, stirring and heating
the curd, draining oV the whey, and collecting or pressing the curd. Desirable ﬂavor and texture are obtained in many cheeses by curing the cheese,
that is, holding it for a speciﬁed time at a speciﬁc temperature and

humidity.

This bulletin contains descriptions of more than 400 cheeses, arranged
in alphabetical order (pp. 4-143). Many cheeses are named for the town
or community in which they are made, or for a landmark of the community. Hence, many cheeses with diVerent local names are practically
the same in their characteristics. On the other hand, several diVerent
kinds are known by the same local name. More than 800 names are
indexed (pp. 145-151).

A typical analysis, based on data in the literature, is given for most
cheeses. In some instances, the analysis includes ﬁgures of composition
prescribed by the Federal Government (see Selected Reference 30, p. 141) .
It was not possible to obtain analytical data for all the cheeses.

It is diVicult, if not impossible, to classify the diVerent cheeses satisfactorily
in groups. Attempts to do so by other writers have not been entirely successful. There probably are only about 18 distinct types or kinds of
natural cheese. No two of these are made by the same method ; that is, the
details of setting the milk, cutting, stirring, heating, draining, pressing, and
salting the curd, and curing the cheese are varied to produce characteristics
and qualities peculiar to each kind of cheese. The following cheeses are
typical of the 18 kinds: Brick, Camembert, Cheddar, Cottage, Cream, Edam,
Gouda, Hand, Limburger, Neufchatel, Parmesan, Provolone, Romano,
Roquefort, Sapsago, Swiss, Trappist, and whey cheeses (Mysost and
Ricotta).","human:What information is available about No one knows who made the ﬁrst cheese, but according to an ancient?

and nearby areas. It was made originally from ewe's milk and was called
Pecorino di Asiago. It is now made from cow's milk and is a sweet-curd,
semicooked, Grana-type cheese with a pungent aroma. It is round and
ﬂat and weighs usually between 16 and 22 pounds. Like other grating
cheeses, it may be used as a table cheese when not aged. Table cheese
of this kind that can be sliced is called Asiago di taglio (slicing cheese).

In Italy, Asiago is made from partly skimmed milk, which is curdled
with rennet at a temperature of 92° to 96° F. The curd is cut into
particles the size of wheat grains, and the temperature is raised to approximately 108° or as high as 118°. After about 15 minutes the greater part
of the whey is run oV. The curd is dipped into circular hoops and pressed.
The cheeses are salted in brine for several days, after which they are
ripened. After curing 4 to 10 months, the cheese is at its best for eating,
resembling Battelmatt; after 12 to 20 months, it is strong and sharp in
ﬂavor and is suitable for grating, resembling Romano and Grana. The
yield of cured cheese is about 7/2 pounds per 100 pounds of milk containing
3.5 percent of fat.

In the United States, three modiﬁcations of Asiago are made, namely,
fresh (soft), medium, and old. The method of manufacture is much the
same for all three and is similar to that used for other Italian cheeses,
such as Fontina, Parmesan, and Romano.

A bacterial starter is added to warm milk that may be standardized
to adjust the fat content. Rennet (preferably in the form of rennet
paste) or rennet extract plus a lipase enzyme preparation is diluted with
water and mixed with the milk. When the curd is suViciently ﬁrm, it
is cut and then heated gradually and stirred continuously. The heating
and cutting are continued until the particles of curd are about the size
of wheat grains. After further stirring and heating, the curd is allowed
to settle to the bottom of the kettle and then is removed by dipping with
a cloth. It is then pressed in hoops.","human:What information is available about Asiago?

It contains a few large eyes. It is made mostly in spring, while the cows
are grazing on green pasture, and is consumed in summer and autumn.
It is popular as a dessert cheese and frequently is eaten with honey and
fruits.

The cheeses are cylindrical and ﬂat, about 8 inches in diameter and
6 inches thick, and weigh about 14 pounds.

The method of manufacture is quite diVerent from that of any other
cheese. Fresh, warm cow's milk is put into a vat without rennet and is
curdled by souring. The curd is cut and stirred until the pieces are the
size of wheat grains. Then hot water (at a temperature of 185° to 195° F.)
is added slowly, with stirring — as much as 1 part of water to 3 parts of
curd and whey. This heats the curd to a temperature of approximately
105° to 110°. To avoid excessive washing, some hot whey may be added
with the water. For 35 to 40 minutes after the curd is cut, whey is expelled
from the granules, and they shrink and acquire ﬁrmness. A sample of
the curd is squeezed in the hand, then rubbed, and when the granules
can be rubbed apart readily the curd is permitted to settle for about
10 minutes and then is dipped with a cloth. The curd is pressed by hand
to expel more whey, is placed in a circular hoop, pressed lightly overnight,
and then — still in the hoop — is placed in a moderately warm room. After
a few days the hoop is removed. The cheese is turned, and may be salted
lightly, each day. After 10 to 15 days a whitish mold growing on the
surface becomes visible, and the rind gradually turns pale yellow.

The cheese has a mild ﬂavor and is ready to eat when it is 1 to 2 months
old. After an additional 2 or 3 months of ripening in a special salt brine
it has more ﬂavor, and is called Salmistra.","human:What information is available about CHEESE VARIETIES AND DESCRIPTIONS?

What information is available about Bakers'?,"Bakers' is a skim-milk cheese very much like Cottage cheese. However,
Bakers' cheese is softer and ﬁner-grained than Cottage cheese and contains
more moisture and acid. In making Bakers' cheese, the curd usually is not
washed and cooked and it is drained in bags rather than in the vat. Bakers'
cheese usually is used in making such bakery products as cheese cake, pie,
and pasteries, but it can also be creamed and eaten like creamed Cottage
cheese.

The milk is pasteurized and cooled to a temperature of 86° to 90° F.
Starter is added, and rennet may be added. After the curd has formed it
is dipped into bags, and these are tied and hung up or piled on a rack to
drain for about 2 hours during which time they are turned occasionally.
Then the bags may be piled and weighted or pressed to remove more whey;
however, it is common practice to use a ﬁlter process to remove whey from
the cheese. Cracked ice may be put around the bags to chill the curd and
retard the development of acidity. The curd may be salted with about
1 percent of salt, or it may be left unsalted. It is packed in tinned cans for
shipment or in wooden tubs for storage. It will keep well for several
months if stored frozen at a temperature below 0°, but usually it is kept at
32° to 35°. From 15 to 18 pounds of cheese is obtained per 100 pounds

of skim milk.

Bakers' cheese may be made from spray-dried nonfat milk solids. Eleven
pounds of milk powder is reconstituted by adding it slowly to 89 pounds of

What information is available about Bel Paese?,"Bel Paese, which means ""beautiful country,"" is the trade name of one
of the best known and most popular of a group of uncooked, soft, sweet,
mild, fast-ripened, Italian table cheeses. Bel Paese was ﬁrst made about
1920 in Melzo, upper Lombardy, Italy, although cheese of this general type
has been made in Italy for approximately 60 years. A similar cheese called
Konigskase is made in Robbio, near Pavia, Italy. Others in the group are
Bella Alpina, Bella Milano, Bel Piano Lombardo, Bel Piemonte Fior d'Alpe,
Savoia, and Vittoria. Similar cheese is marketed in other European coun-

tries under such names as Schonland and Fleur des Alpes, and the group
is also referred to as Butter cheese, especially in Germany; a similar so-called
Butter cheese is made in Canada.

Production of a soft cheese of the Bel Paese type was introduced in the
United States by the Bureau of Dairy Industry in 1938 and the cheese which
is now being made commercially is said to be of as high quality in every
respect as that made in Italy. Innovations made here in the method include pasteurization of the milk and the use of a uniformly active lactic
starter, which improve the quality and uniformity of the cheese and practically eliminate defects. Because of the Italian trade-mark, cheese of this
type made in the United States is sold under various other names.

A small percentage of an active lactic starter (usually 0.25 percent or
slightly more) is added to cpw's whole milk (which should be strictly fresh
and pasteurized), at a temperature of 104° to 110° F. Enough rennet is
added so that the curd will be ﬁrm enough for cutting in 15 to 20 minutes —
usually from 10 to 20 milliliters of rennet (diluted with water) per 100
pounds of milk is suVicient.

The curd is cut into %-inch cubes and is stirred carefully, at ﬁrst by hand
and then with a rake, to prevent matting and to insure rapid expulsion of
the whey. During this period the setting temperature is maintained.
When the curd particles have ﬁrmed suViciently, the whey is drawn oV and
the curd is dipped into forms placed on reed mats on a draining table.
The forms are preferably square or round perforated metal forms but square
wooden forms are also used. A follower, or cover, is placed on the curd
in each form. In Italy the curd may be transferred to the forms within

30 minutes after the rennet is added. The cheeses are drained in the forms
for 5 to 7 hours and are turned frequently during this period. The room
temperature should be about 80°. A box cover may be placed over the
forms to aid in maintaining the temperature of the cheese.

The cheeses are salted by placing them in a 16- to 18-percent salt solution
at 55° F. for 14 to 18 hours. Then they are dried and placed on shelves
in the curing room in which the temperature is 38° to 42° and the relative
humidity is 80 to 90 percent. Some ﬁne salt may be sprinkled on the
surface of the cheeses.

Soon after curing is begun a nearly colorless or slightly gray or brownish
slime appears on the surface, and this is desirable for characteristic ripening.
The cheeses are washed with dilute salt brine and are turned 2 or 3 times

Bernarde or Formagelle Bernarde, an Italian cheese, is made from cow's
whole milk to which about 10 percent of goat's milk is added for ﬂavor.
The milk is ripened for 3 or 4 hours. It is colored lightly with saVron.
SuVicient rennet is added to coagulate the milk in about 45 minutes at a
temperature of 93° to 95° F., after which the curd is turned and then
left to settle for 5 minutes. It is then broken with a harp until the pieces
are the size of hazelnuts. The temperature is increased slightly and the
curd is allowed to settle for about 10 minutes. It is placed in hoops and
cured in a highly humid room at a temperature of 50° to 59°. After
3 days in the curing room salting is begun. In the following 18 days

Bernarde

Bernarde or Formagelle Bernarde, an Italian cheese, is made from cow's
whole milk to which about 10 percent of goat's milk is added for ﬂavor.
The milk is ripened for 3 or 4 hours. It is colored lightly with saVron.
SuVicient rennet is added to coagulate the milk in about 45 minutes at a
temperature of 93° to 95° F., after which the curd is turned and then
left to settle for 5 minutes. It is then broken with a harp until the pieces
are the size of hazelnuts. The temperature is increased slightly and the
curd is allowed to settle for about 10 minutes. It is placed in hoops and
cured in a highly humid room at a temperature of 50° to 59°. After
3 days in the curing room salting is begun. In the following 18 days
about 2.5 to 3 percent of salt is added by rubbing dry salt on the surface
of the cheese 3 or 4 times. The cheese is ready to eat after curing for
2 months."
What information is available about Bgug-Panir?,"Bgug-Panir cheese, sometimes called Daralag, is made in Armenia from
partly or entirely skimmed ewe's milk. Rennet is used to coagulate the
milk, and the curd is put into a rack to drain after which it is broken up.
Salt and herbs are added, and the cheese is pressed. After pressing, it is
put into a salt bath for 2 days or more, after which it is cured.

Bitto

Bitto is a ﬁrm, semicooked cheese of the Swiss group, made originally
in Friuli and now made also in Lombardy, in northern Italy. It is similar
to Fontina and Montasio. It is made from cow's milk, from ewe's milk,
or from a mixture of goat's milk and cow's milk, and from whole, slightly
skimmed, or skim milk. It is heated to a temperature of 93° to 98° F.,
and suVicient rennet is added to coagulate the milk in 30 to 35 minutes.
The curd is then subdivided and heated in about 30 minutes to a temperature between 113° and 122°. The curd is dipped and pressed; the
cheese is dry-salted over a period of 25 to 40 days and is cured — sometimes
for as long as 2 years. The cheese weighs between 35 and 75 pounds.
It has small eyes. When made from whole milk and not fully cured, it is
used as table cheese. When made from skim milk and fully cured, it is
grated and used as a condiment.","human:What information is available about Bgug-Panir?

information on making it from cow's milk. Following is a brief description
of the making process :

Lactic starter is added to fresh clean milk, which may be pasteurized and
may be homogenized, and it is set with rennet at a temperature of 84° F.
From 1 to V/z hours later the coagulated curd is cut, then the whey is
drained oV and the curd is placed in perforated metal hoops that are about
l l /2 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep. Blue-mold powder is mixed
with the curd, either while it is still in the vat or while it is being put into the
hoops, and some salt may be mixed with it. The hoops are turned frequently and the curd is held in the hoops at least 24 hours. Salting may be
started either when the cheeses are removed from the hoops or several days
later . The cheeses are dry-salted over a period of 7 to 10 days in a room
which is maintained at a temperature of 46° to 48° and a relative humidity
of about 95 percent. About a week after salting, each cheese is pierced
with 40 or more J/s-inch holes to permit air to reach the interior of the
cheese; this is essential for mold growth. Then the cheeses are placed on
their edges on racks in the curing room. They are cured for 3 months at a

temperature of 48° and a relative humidity of 95 percent and are scraped

formation and growth of foreign molds on the surface. Then they are

and sweet ﬂavor, midway between Cheddar and Limburger but not so sharp
as Cheddar and not so strong as Limburger. The body is softer than Cheddar but ﬁrmer than Limburger, is elastic, and slices well without crumbling.
Brick has an open texture with numerous round and irregular shaped eyes
(holes) . Al though the exact derivation of the name is unknown, it may
refer to its brick-like shape or to the bricks used in pressing.

High-quality whole milk, preferably pasteurized, is warmed to a temperature of 88° to 92° F. Lactic starter is added, and enough rennet so the
curd will be ﬁrm enough to cut in about 30 minutes. After the curd is cut
into cubes and stirred gently for 15 to 25 minutes, it is warmed in about 45
minutes to a temperature of 106° to 110°, or even as low as 96° and as high
as 1 15° in some cases (depending on the size of the cubes and the rate of acid
development). The ﬁnal cooking temperature is maintained until the
curd is transferred to the forms. Part of the whey is removed, and the
curd either is stirred in the remainder of the whey or warm water (at the
cooking temperature) is added and stirring is continued. When the curd
reaches the desired degree of ﬁrmness, the curd-whey mixture is dipped

of their broad sides on a salting table. Salting is repeated daily for 3 days.","human:What information is available about Brick?
bot:Brick cheese, one of the few cheeses of American origin, is made in considerable quantities in numerous factories, particularly in Wisconsin. It is
a sweet-curd, semisoft, cow's-milk cheese, with a mild but rather pungent
and sweet ﬂavor, midway between Cheddar and Limburger but not so sharp
as Cheddar and not so strong as Limburger. The body is softer than Cheddar but ﬁrmer than Limburger, is elastic, and slices well without crumbling.
Brick has an open texture with numerous round and irregular shaped eyes
(holes) . Al though the exact derivation of the name is unknown, it may
refer to its brick-like shape or to the bricks used in pressing.

High-quality whole milk, preferably pasteurized, is warmed to a temperature of 88° to 92° F. Lactic starter is added, and enough rennet so the
curd will be ﬁrm enough to cut in about 30 minutes. After the curd is cut
into cubes and stirred gently for 15 to 25 minutes, it is warmed in about 45
minutes to a temperature of 106° to 110°, or even as low as 96° and as high
as 1 15° in some cases (depending on the size of the cubes and the rate of acid
development). The ﬁnal cooking temperature is maintained until the
curd is transferred to the forms. Part of the whey is removed, and the
curd either is stirred in the remainder of the whey or warm water (at the
cooking temperature) is added and stirring is continued. When the curd
reaches the desired degree of ﬁrmness, the curd-whey mixture is dipped
into the forms.

The forms, which are made of wood or perforated metal and have no top
or bottom, are rectangular (10 inches long, 5 inches wide, and 5 5/2 inches
deep) . They are placed on a mat or metal screen on a drain table.

ﬁrst in southern Italy but now is made also in Sicily and in summer in
northern Italy. In northern Italy it is made chieﬂy for export. It is especially suitable for making in warm climates, as it keeps well. The cured
cheese has a smooth, ﬁrm body, and preferably the interior of the cheese is
white.

Caciocavallo and Provolone are made by almost identical methods. However, Caciocavallo contains less fat than Provolone and usually is not smoked,
and each is molded in distinctive shapes. Typically, Caciocavallo is spindleshaped, with a pointed bottom and with a neck and head at the top. One
theory of the origin of the name is that the cheeses, which are tied in pairs
and hung over poles to cure, look as if they were hung over a saddle ; hence,
cheese on horseback, or ""cacio a cavallo.""

Caciocavallo is made usually from cow's milk, but sometimes from a
mixture of cow's and ewe's milk. Evening milk is skimmed and mixed with
whole morning milk in a vat or wooden tub. Starter may be added ; whey
from the previous day, containing lactobacilli and thermophilic streptococci,
may be used. The milk is set at a temperature of about 96° F. with rennet,
preferably rennet paste. The curd is cut in 20 to 30 minutes, with a metal
skimmer and then with a stirrer, into pieces about the size of a pea. After
the curd settles, the whey is removed and the curd is pressed.

The compressed curd is transferred to a wooden tub in a warm room and
covered with hot whey. An energetic fermentation occurs. As soon as a
sample of the curd will stretch into a tough, elastic ﬁber when it is immersed
in very hot water, it is ready for draining and molding (this may be from
5 to 8 hours or as long as 20 hours after fermentation begins) .

The curd is transferred to a special table to drain; then it is cut into long
thin slices which are placed in a tub and covered with very hot water. The
slices are worked with a paddle and by hand until they are very elastic;
then they are drawn into rope-like pieces of uniform size and draped on a
pole. These rope-like pieces are molded into the typical Caviocavallo shape.
While being molded they are immersed occasionally in very hot water to
keep them hot. Molding while hot expels whey from the curd and produces
cheese with a compact curd, free of openings, and with a properly sealed
surface.

The cheese are placed in a vat of cold water— on a cloth stretched under
the water or in forms — for 3 or 4 hours, to cool and harden. Then they are
salted in brine at about 50° F. for 3 or 4 days, after which they are dried,

or a mixture of the two. According to some authorities, it is always made
in the shape of an oblong block. Each cheese weighs between 17^> and
26 pounds.

The method of making Caciocavallo Siciliano is similar to the method
of making Gaciocavallo and Provolone, except for the following: The
curd is not placed in cold water to ﬁrm it, but is pressed in forms. Although
according to some authorities it may be salted in brine, it usually is salted
with dry salt over a period of about 20 days. It is not smoked and may
be paraVined. It is cured for at least 3 months and is used both as a
table cheese and for grating. (See Gaciocavallo and Provolone.)

Analysis : Moisture, not more than 40 percent ; fat in the solids, not less
than 42 percent."
What information is available about Cacio Fiore?,"Cacio Fiore, also called Gaciotta, is a soft, yellowish, Italian cheese with
a delicate, buttery ﬂavor. It has a soft and delicate curd similar to Bel
Paese and the Stracchino and Grescenza cheeses of Lombardy. It is made
from ewe's or goat's milk, usually in the cold winter months.

Whole milk is colored with saVron and is set at a temperature of 95° F.,
preferably with vegetable rennet extract (caglio ﬁore) . Use of this extract,
which is prepared from salt water and wild artichoke ﬂowers (ﬁore),
produces the soft, delicate curd. After a coagulation period of 25 minutes,

the curd is broken into comparatively large pieces and is dipped into
rectangular or round wooden forms that are lined with linen cloth; the
forms are placed on straw mats on an inclined table to drain. After draining, the cheese is salted with dry salt and is kept on a straw mat and turned
daily. It is ready to eat about 10 days after it is made. The average
yield is 25 to 30 pounds of cheese per 100 pounds of milk. Each cheese
weighs between 2 and 4*/2 pounds.

Cacio Fiore Aquilano is a similar cheese that usually is made in winter
(January and February). It is a rectangular, fast-ripening, Stracchino
(Lombardy) type cheese made from ewe's milk, preferably with vegetable
(ﬁore) rennet, although good results can be obtained also with calf rennet.

Fresh milk is colored with saVron and is set with rennet at a temperature
of 95° F. After a coagulation period of 50 minutes, the curd is cut, drained,
placed in the forms, and salted in the same way as in making Grescenza.
(See Crescenza.) This cheese should be eaten within a month after it is
made.

diameter and 2/2 to 3/ 2 inches thick, and weighs about 8 pounds. The

cheese is white and smooth, lacks elasticity, and is granular rather than
waxy when broken.

Fresh whole milk is inoculated with starter and ripened slightly. The
milk is heated to 84° or 90° F., and rennet is added. After a curdling
period of 40 to 60 minutes, the curd is cut into small pieces, stirred carefully
for 10 minutes, and (if the rennet was added at 84°) warmed gradually
to 90° in another 20 minutes. Then the whey is drained oV, and the
curd is ladled into small cloth bags which are hung up for draining or
pressed lightly. After about an hour the curd is broken up or it may be
cut into small cubes, and it is repressed. Again the curd is broken up,
and salt is mixed in at the rate of 1 ounce of salt to 3 pounds of curd.
The curd is then placed in cloth-lined forms and again pressed. The
cheeses are redressed and repressed after several hours, and then daily, with
gradually increasing pressure, for about 3 days. They are cured on shelves

Brie, but it is smaller and the characteristic ﬂavor diVers.

The method of making Camembert is in general as follows : Good-quality
whole milk or milk standardized to a fat content of 3.5 percent is put in
small vats or in ﬂat-bottomed,, conical metal cans that hold about 200
pounds. Lactic starter is added, and the milk is warmed to a temperature

"What information is available about The hoops are turned and the mats are changed after a few hours, and?","this procedure is repeated frequently for about 2 days. At the end of the
ﬁrst day, the cheeses will have settled to a thickness of 1 l /<z to 1^4 inches, and
the deeper hoops may be removed. At the end of the second day, the
cheeses are removed from the hoops, salted with ﬁne dry salt, and may be
inoculated with a culture of mold and bacteria. The culture either is
mixed with the salt and rubbed on the surface of the cheeses, or it is dissolved in water and sprayed on. Then the cheeses are moved to the
curing room.

Curing the cheese is the most diVicult part of the manufacturing process
for there must be a uniform and progressive development of the ripening
agents and at the same time the curd must dry gradually but not too
rapidly. The cheeses are cured on open board frames or shelves at a temperature of about 55° F. and a relative humidity of 85 to 90 percent for
about 3 weeks; then at a temperature of 48° to 50°. In the United States,
if the cheese is made from raw milk it is cured for at least 60 days. They
are turned frequently. A primary surface growth of a grayish-white felt-like
layer of mold is followed by a secondary fermentation that produces a trace
of sliminess and changes the surface to show spots of yellow and ﬁnally a
reddish or russet color; at the same time the interior of the curd becomes
creamy and somewhat yellow.

The cheeses are wrapped in paper, parchment, or cellophane and may
be covered with metal foil; they usually are packed in round, ﬂat, wooden or
plastic boxes. Sometimes they are cut in pie-shaped segments for marketing, but they are said to cure more normally if they are not cut. From 1 3

manner similar to Bel Paese. Micro-organisms growing on the surface of
the cheese are partly responsible for the characteristic ripening. However,
Ghantelle is coated with red cheese wax when the surface ripening is at an
earlier stage of development than in Bel Paese; it is cured at somewhat
higher temperatures; and it does not soften so much in ripening. It may
be shipped about 3 weeks after it is made, in which ca.se it undergoes
further ripening while it is being transported and marketed. It is somewhat similar to Trappist cheese; that is, it has a characteristic mild ﬂavor,
a rather open texture, and a smooth, waxy body suitable for slicing. It is
round and ﬂat, about 8 inches in diameter, and weighs about 5 pounds.

often is called American cheese, or American Cheddar cheese, and cheeses
similar to Cheddar but made by a slightly modiﬁed process are called

American-type cheeses. (See American.)

In addition to being the name of the cheese, Cheddar is the name of a
step in the manufacturing process and also the name of the most common
style, which is about 14 J/2 inches in diameter, 12 inches thick, and weighs
between 70 and 78 pounds. Other styles are: Daisy, which is about 13%
inches in diameter, slightly more than 4 inches thick, and weighs 21 to 23
pounds; Flat or Twin, which is 14*/2 inches in diameter, slightly more than
5 inches thick, and weighs 32 to 37 pounds; Longhorn, which is 6 inches
in diameter, 13 inches long, and weighs 12 to 13 pounds; Young American,
which is 7 inches in diameter, 7 inches thick, and weighs 11 to 12 pounds;
Picnic or Junior Twin, which is 9% inches in diameter, 5 inches thick,
and weighs 1 1 to 12 pounds; and rectangular blocks or prints, which usually
are 14 inches long, 11 inches in diameter, 3% inches thick, and weigh
20 pounds. However, they are made in larger sizes that weigh up to 80
pounds. The blocks are often cut into prints and packaged (see Natural
Rindless Loaf). In many stores, the 1-pound print is most popular.

Cheddar is a hard cheese, ranging in color from nearly white to yellow.
It is made from sweet, whole cow's milk, either raw or pasteurized. ( If it
is made from partly skimmed or skim milk, it must be so labeled.)

Research has shown that pasteurizing the milk improves the quality of
the cheese; and that cheese of uniformly good quality can be made from
pasteurized milk by the so-called time-schedule method. Use of the time
schedule systematizes the cheese-making operations and makes it possible
to control the amount of acid that develops and the rate of its development
during the making process. More than 75 percent of the Cheddar cheese

made in the United States is now made from pasteurized milk by this
method.

The pasteurized milk is cooled to the setting temperature (86° to 88° F.)
and run into the cheese vat. Starter is added and the milk is agitated
(stirred) usually for about an hour as the milk ripens (develops acidity).
The amount of starter and the length of the ripening period are adjusted
so that acid will develop at the desired rate during the making process.
Then rennet and color are mixed in thoroughly and stirring is stopped.
When the curd is suViciently ﬁrm, usually about 30 minutes after setting,
it is cut with curd knives into %-inch or %-inch cubes. It is stirred continuously from cutting to dipping (draining the whey) . About 15 minutes
after cutting is completed, the curd is heated gradually (in about 30 minutes) to a temperature of about 100°.

About 2 l A hours after the rennet was added, the curd is pushed back
from, the gate end of the vat, and the whey is drained. Draining should
be completed in 15 minutes; then a ditch is made down the middle of the
vat and the curd is packed about 7 or 8 inches deep on each side. When
it is ﬁrm enough to be turned without breaking it is cheddared or matted,
that is, it is cut into slabs 5 or 6 inches wide which are turned frequently
and, ﬁnally, when ﬁrm enough, piled in layers. Then the curd is run
through a curd mill and spread evenly over the bottom of the vat and

stirred. About 2 l /2 to 3J/s> pounds of salt for each 1,000 pounds of milk
is mixed in; and the curd is piled on either side of the vat while the whey
drains.

When the salt has dissolved completely, the curd is transferred to clothlined metal hoops and pressed for about 30 minutes. Then the hoops are
removed from the press, the cheeses are dressed, pressed again for 12 to 24
hours, and then removed from the hoops and dried for 3 or 4 days at a
temperature of 50° to 60° F.

After drying, they are dipped in paraVin or cheese wax. Then they
usually are boxed (1 to 4 in a box) and shipped to a warehouse to cure;
however, sometimes they are cured unboxed on shelves at the factory.

They are cured usually at a temperature between 40° and 50° F., but
it may be as low as 35° or as high as 60°. They are cured for at least 60
days, usually for 3 to 6 months, and in some instances for as long as a year.
Between 9]/2 and 11 pounds of cheese is obtained per 100 pounds of milk.

What information is available about Cheshire?,"Cheshire, which is also called Chester, ranks with Cheddar as the oldest
and most popular of English cheeses; both were well known as early as
the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Cheshire was ﬁrst made in the village of

Chester on the river Dee; it is said that it was molded originally in the
form of the famous ""Cheshire Cat.""

Cheshire is a ﬁrm cheese, but it is more crumbly and not so compact
as Cheddar. It is cylindrical in shape, like Cheddar; the cheeses are about
14 inches in diameter and usually between 50 and 70 pounds in weight.
The curd may be nearly white but more often it is colored deep yellow with
annatto.

There are three general types of Cheshire cheese: (1) Early-ripening,
which is made from early spring until May and which usually is marketed
locally; (2) medium-ripening, which is made in May and June and in the
autumn and which is the most common type; and (3) late-ripening, which
is made in summer, is cured more fully, and is sold in more distant markets.
The three types diVer slightly in the details of manufacture, such as the
setting temperature, the rate of development of acidity, the cutting of the
curd, and the cooking temperature. Following is a general description
of the method of making medium-ripening Cheshire :

Evening and morning milk are mixed in a cheese vat, color usually is
added, and the milk is set with lactic starter and rennet at a temperature
of 86° F. After a coagulation period of an hour, the curd is stirred carefully and cut gradually to ﬁne particles with a curd breaker or curd knives.

remaining whey and then is stirred and warmed to 88°. In the next 30
or 40 minutes the curd settles again in the whey, after which the whey is
drained oV. Then the loosely matted curd is rolled up to one end of the

after which the curd is cut into rather large cubes and is spread on a curd
cloth on a drain rack. After it has drained for 2 to 3 hours, during which
time it is turned occasionally, it is cut into small cubes. It is kept warm
while it continues to drain. Then it is put through a curd mill, salt is
mixed in at the rate of 3 to 4 pounds per 100 pounds of curd, and it is placed
in forms. There are holes in the sides of the forms through which skewers
(pegs) are inserted to make holes in the cheese to facilitate the drainage of
whey. The forms, which may be turned occasionally, are kept overnight
in a cheese oven or other warm place at a temperature between 75° and 80°.
The next morning the cheese is removed from the forms, dressed in cloth,
and placed in a press. It is pressed for about 4 days and turned daily
while in the press; the pressure is increased gradually until ﬁnally it reaches
about 2,000 pounds. The cheese is removed from the press, scalded in hot
water, and dressed in a bandage. It is cured on shelves in a curing room

or crocks with airtight covers. When marketed in the latter type of package,
the cheese sometimes is called Potted cheese.

This type of product can be made at home; however, grinding and mixing
the cheese changes its texture and the product is inclined to be ""mealy.""
The housewife can make the product richer and increase its smoothness by
adding butter. When made for sale commercially, however, adding the
butter makes the product subject to the Federal law that restricts the manufacture and sale of ""ﬁlled"" cheese. ( See Filled cheese. )

What information is available about Cooked?,"Cooked cheese (German, Kochkase, literally Cook cheese) is so named

in diVerent countries and in diVerent localities within a country, and the
cheese is known by diVerent local names. In the United States, the local
names include Cup cheese and Pennsylvania Pot cheese; in northern Ger-

many, it is called Topfen; and in Sardinia, Fresa. When properly made,
Cooked cheese has an agreeable ﬂavor and a smooth buttery consistency
similar to Camembert.

The fresh cheese curd which is the basic ingredient of Cooked cheese
is made from skim milk, or reconstituted concentrated skim milk or nonfat
dry milk solids, or a mixture of any of these. The curd usually is prepared
in the same way as ordinary Cottage-cheese curd and preferably should
be rather dry. (See Cottage cheese.)

The fresh curd is either stirred thoroughly or ground in a meat grinder,
after which it is placed in a container, such as a crock or pot, covered,
and kept warm until it ripens. It is stirred once or twice a day while it
ripens. Usually it will ripen suViciently in 3 or 4 days at a temperature
of 80° to 85° F., in about 5 days at 75°, and in a week at 70°. The
length of the ripening period depends on the softness and moisture content
of the original curd, the temperature at which it is held, and the ﬂavor
desired in the ﬁnished cheese. The curd is ripened to a lesser extent if
cheese with a mild ﬂavor is desired.

Sometimes soda is added to the curd before it is cooked, at the rate of
y 4 teaspoon of soda per pound of curd or 1 pound per 100 pounds of curd.
The soda aids in softening the curd; when it is added the ripening period
is shortened or may even be omitted.

When ripe the curd consists of two layers. On the top is a layer of
particles of curd covered with a wrinkled, gelatinous, viscous mass of
mold mycelia, beneath which is a layer of semiliquid curd with a char-

acteristic strong ﬂavor and odor. It may be slightly yellow throughout.

Sometimes ﬂavoring materials, such as butter or cream, salt, caraway
seed, egg, pimentos, or olives, are added either just before the curd is
cooked or just before it is poured into the glasses.","human:What information is available about Cooked?

What information is available about Cottage?,"Cottage cheese, sometimes called Pot cheese and also Dutch cheese or
Schmierkase, is a soft, uncured cheese made from skim milk or from
reconstituted concentrated skim milk or nonfat dry milk solids.

Large-grained, low-acid cheese is made by adding rennet to the milk,
cutting the curd into large cubes, and washing the curd thoroughly to
reduce the acid ﬂavor. It is known as sweet-curd Cottage cheese, ﬂake-type
Cottage cheese, and low-acid rennet-type Cottage cheese. The large
particles of curd resemble kernels of popped corn, and in some localities
this kind of cheese is called Popcorn cheese. Small-grained Cottage cheese
sometimes is called country-style or farm-style cheese.

Usually some cream is mixed with the cheese curd before it is marketed
or consumed. If the cheese contains 4 percent or more of fat, it is called
Creamed Cottage cheese. Flavoring materials, such as peppers, olives, and
pimentos, may be added also.

Large quantities of Cottage cheese are made and consumed in the United
States; it is highly nutritious and palatable and is used as a table cheese
and in salads. It is easy to make both in the home and in the factory. In
the home, about 1 pound of cheese is obtained from 1 gallon of skim milk;
in the factory, from 12 to 15 pounds of curd is obtained from 100 pounds of
skim milk and this makes from 14 to 18 pounds of Creamed Cottage cheese.

Cottage cheese may be made by either the short-setting method or the
long-setting method. In the short-setting method, more lactic starter is
added to the milk than in the long-setting method; the milk is set at a higher

temperature; and the coagulation period is shorter. In both methods, the
milk is pasteurized and cooled to the setting temperature. Lactic starter
is added; rennet may be added; and the milk is held at the setting temperature until it curdles.

The curd is ready to cut when it is ﬁrm but not hard and brittle. It is
cut into cubes, the size determining to some extent the size of the curd
particles in the ﬁnished cheese. Then the curd is heated, with careful
stirring. The temperature to which the curd is heated and the length of
the heating period depend on the characteristics of the curd and the acidity
of the whey. When the curd has attained the proper ﬁrmness, the whey
is drained oV and the curd washed ﬁrst with cool tap water, then with ice
water, and then the water is drained oV. When the curd is ﬁrm and dry,
it is salted. It may be creamed and packed in consumer-size cartons.
However, it is customary for the manufacturer to pack the curd in tubs or
tins that hold as much as 50 pounds for shipping to the distributor, who
creams and packs it in consumer-size cartons to supply his daily needs. The
curd may be held for several days at a temperature of 32° to 35° F.","human:What information is available about Cottage?

cheese. According to some authorities, Coulommiers and the smallest
(1 -pound) Brie are identical; according to other authorities, Coulommiers
is similar to Brie and to Camembert, but is ripened for a shorter period.
(See Brie for a description of the making process.)

A modiﬁed Coulommiers cheese is made in the United States and Canada.
It is suitable for making in the home as the process and equipment are
simple. It usually is eaten fresh or when only a few days old. If mellower
cheese with a stronger ﬂavor is desired, it may be held for a week or two,
although by that time the surface of the cheese may be moldy. ^ The
cheeses are round and ﬂat, about 5/ 2 inches in diameter and 1 to I/2 inches
thick, and they weigh between % and 1 pound. The yield is I/3 to 2
pounds of cheese per gallon of milk.

Cow's fresh, whole milk, or a mixture of evening and morning milk, is
warmed to 86° F. (some authorities recommend 80°), in a vat or other
container. Lactic starter and rennet are added, the amount depending
on the condition of the milk and whether it is desired to have the curd ﬁrm
enough to cut in 30 minutes, in 1 to V/2 hours, or in 2 to 3 hours. After
the rennet is added, the surface of the mixture is stirred gently for a few
minutes to keep the cream from rising, but stirring is discontinued before

coagulation begins. The temperature of the milk should not go below
80°. While the curd is still soft, large ladlefuls are removed and set aside
to be placed on the cheeses later to form smooth tops.

The coagulated curd may be cut into / 2 - or ^4 -inch cubes and ladled
carefully into the hoops about 15 minutes after cutting; or it may be cut
into thin slices with a sharp-edged ladle and transferred to the hoops without breaking. The set-aside curd is put into the hoops last.

The hoops are metal, open at top and bottom, and perforated on the
sides to permit drainage of the whey. They are about 5 inches in diameter and consist of two ﬁtted sections — a lower section about 2 inches deep
and an upper collar 3 inches deep. Two to four hoops are placed on a
drain mat which is spread on a movable board on a grooved drain table.

The temperature of the room should be at least .68° F. so the curd will
drain and ﬁrm properly, and the hoops are covered to reduce loss of heat.
The hoops are turned frequently at ﬁrst, then less often, as the curd settles
and drains. When the curd has settled into the lower half of the hoops,
the top half is removed and a drain mat is placed over the hoops with a
drain board over the mat, and the hoops together with the board are turned

What information is available about The method of making Cream cheese varies in the diVerent factories in?,"the United States; following is a general description:

The cream, or milk-and-cream mixture, which usually is homogenized, is
pasteurized, cooled to a temperature of 75° to 85° F., and lactic-acid culture,
with or without rennet, is added. After the curd forms, it is stirred until
it is smooth and then is heated by one of two methods. In one method, the
curd is heated in the vat, with stirring, to a temperature of 115° to 125°
and held at that temperature until the whey begins to separate from the
curd. Then the curd is ready to drain. It may be placed in draining
bags immediately or it may be cooled before it is placed in the bags. In
the other method, the curd is stirred until it is smooth, and stirring is continued as hot water (equal to the volume of curd) is added. The temperature of the water should be about 170° to 180°. When the curdwater mixture reaches a temperature of 120° to 130°, it is poured into the
draining bags.

When whey has practically stopped draining from the curd, the cheese is
packaged by either the cold-pack method or the hot-pack method. In the
cold-pack method, thexurd is pressed and chilled, and salt is added; it is
then mixed until it is smooth, and ﬂavoring materials — such as pimentoes,
olives, pineapple, or relish — may be added. Usually it is packed in metal
foil or in glasses sealed with metal tops.

In the hot-pack method, the curd is stirred and salted, and any one of
several dairy ingredients may be added. Then the mixture is pasteurized,
it may be homogenized, ﬂavoring material may be added, and it is packed
immediately (while it is in a semiﬂuid condition) in the ﬁnal package.

Analysis: Moisture, not more than 55 percent (usually 48 to 52 percent) ;

Factory production of cheese in England began in 1870 with the establishment of two factories for making Derby cheese. This made it possible to
produce cheese more uniform in quality and size than was made in farm
dairies. The cheeses are circular, about 15 inches in diameter and 5 inches
thick, and weigh about 30 pounds.

A mixture of evening and morning milk is warmed to a temperature of
80° to 85° F. Lactic starter and rennet are added, and color is added for
certain markets. About an hour after the milk is set, the curd should be
very ﬁrm. It is then cut, heated with stirring to a temperature of 96° in
50 minutes, and the whey is drained oV. Sometimes the curd is placed on
a cloth on a drain rack to drain, and sometimes the whey is expelled by
pressing the curd lightly, then more heavily, in the vat. The matted curd
is cut into large blocks which are kept warm and are turned occasionally as
the whey continues to drain and then develops ﬁrmness.

When the curd is suViciently ﬁrm — usually in about 40 minutes — it is

What information is available about Domiati?,"Domiati, a so-called pickled cheese and one of the most popular Egyptian
cheeses, is made also in some of the other tropical countries where Arabic
is spoken. It is made from whole or partly skimmed cow's or buValo's
milk. It is a soft, white cheese with no openings, mild and salty in ﬂavor
when fresh and cleanly acid when cured. When it is held for prolonged
periods (a year or more) it darkens in color and develops a strong ﬂavor.
The cheeses usually are V/ 2 inches thick and about 3 l /s inches square;
but sometimes they are cylindrical in shape, either 2/2 or 5 inches in
diameter.

The principal characteristic that distinguishes Domiati from other cheeses
is that salt is added to the milk at the beginning of the cheese-making
process, before rennet is added. Usually from 5 to 15 percent of salt is
added to two-thirds of the milk, and the rest is heated to a temperature
of 170° F.; then the two portions are mixed, and rennet is added at 105°
to 115°. However, if the cheese is made in a jacketed vat so a constant
temperature can be maintained, a setting temperature of 95° to 100° is
preferable. After a coagulation period of 2 to 3 hours, the curd is ladled
into metal hoops or wooden forms lined with mosquito netting. If a large
quantity of cheese is being made, a form may be made by fastening planks

to a drain table. The forms vary in size. The smallest are the size of a
single cheese, a large wooden form may hold 100 pounds of curd, and a
form made of planks may hold as much as a ton.

The curd in the small hoops or forms is inverted frequently; that in
the large forms is pressed and then cut into suitable sizes for marketing.
If it is to be marketed as fresh cheese, it is wrapped in waxed paper. If it
is to be cured, it is pickled in salt-whey or salt-milk brine. For local
markets, the cheese is cured for 4 to 8 months in the brine solution in
earthenware containers. For shipping, the cheese in the brine solution
is sealed in tin containers.

What information is available about Edam?,"Edam cheese was ﬁrst made in the vicinity of Edam in the Province of
North Holland, Netherlands. It is known in the Netherlands by various
local names, such as Manbollen, Katzenkopf, and Tete de Maure. Like
Gouda, it is a semisoft to hard, sweet-curd cheese made from cow's milk.
Originally it was made from whole milk but now the fat content of the
milk is usually reduced to about 2.5 percent. When the cheese is made for
export, the fat content is indicated on the label, according to Government speciﬁcations. Edam is made also in the United States.

Edam has a pleasingly mild, clean, sometimes salty, ﬂavor and a rather
ﬁrm and crumbly body, free of holes and openings. It usually is shaped
like a ﬂattened ball, but in the United States it is made also in a loaf shape.
The cheeses usually weigh from to 4 5/2 pounds but sometimes weigh as
much as 14 pounds. In the United States, they sometimes weigh only
about % to 1 pound.

High-quality milk should be used in making Edam; if the milk is pasteurized, as is common in the United States, lactic starter is added. Color
may be added and the milk is set with rennet extract. About 15 minutes
later the curd is cut into %-inch cubes, then stirred and heated to a temperature of 90° to 95° F. When the curd is suViciently ﬁrm, part of the
whey is drained oV. When enough whey has drained so that the curd is
exposed, the curd is pushed to the side of the vat and more whey pressed
out. The curd is stirred and may be salted. The temperature of the curd
should be at least 88° when it is put into the molds for pressing.

Special pressing molds, preferably metal but sometimes hardwood and
lined with cheesecloth, are used. Each has a round lower section about
6 inches deep and 6 inches in diameter, with holes in the bottom for drainage, and a round cover. In the United States the cheese sometimes is
pressed in rectangular loaf -shaped molds.

The molds are ﬁlled with curd, covered, and then pressed for about 30
minutes with a pressure of 20 to 30 pounds. Then the cheeses are removed
from the molds and dipped in warm whey (at a temperature of 125° to
130° F.). The rough edges of curd are trimmed oV, and the cheeses are
bandaged and again pressed for 6 to 12 hours with a pressure of 60 to 120
pounds.

The cheeses then are rubbed with ﬁne salt and placed in salt in special
salting molds that are the same shape as the pressing molds but have no
covers. Salting is continued for 5 or 6 days, and the cheeses are turned
daily. In the United States, and less commonly in the Netherlands, the

cheeses are salted by immersion in a salting bath for about a week; however,
dry salting is preferable as it aids in producing a smooth rind.

The cheeses are scrubbed with a brush in warm water or whey, wiped
dry, and then cured on shelves at a temperature of 50° to 60° F. and a
relative humidity of 80 to 90 percent. They are piled in layers on the
shelves to aid in ﬂattening the top and bottom surfaces. They are washed,
dried, and turned daily for a week or two, then less frequently. In some
factories they are washed in a churn-like machine, and the surfaces may
be smoothed by rotating the cheeses in a machine that resembles a lathe.

In the Netherlands, cheese for export is colored red, rubbed with oil,
and wrapped in some transparent material; the red coating is an identifying characteristic of Edam cheese. However, cheese made for consumption
within that country is rubbed with oil but not colored.

In the United States, Edam cheese is covered with red paraVin or some
other tightly adhering red coating.

The cheeses are packed usually 8 to 12 in a box; for export to warm
climates they may be sealed in tins. Between 8 and 9 pounds of cured
cheese is obtained per 100 pounds of milk.

Analysis : Moisture, not more than 45 percent (usually 35 to 38 percent) ;
fat, 26.5 to 29.5 percent (not less than.40 percent in the solids) ; protein,
27 to 29 percent; and salt, 1.6 to 2 percent.","human:What information is available about Edam?
bot:Edam cheese was ﬁrst made in the vicinity of Edam in the Province of
North Holland, Netherlands. It is known in the Netherlands by various
local names, such as Manbollen, Katzenkopf, and Tete de Maure. Like
Gouda, it is a semisoft to hard, sweet-curd cheese made from cow's milk.
Originally it was made from whole milk but now the fat content of the
milk is usually reduced to about 2.5 percent. When the cheese is made for
export, the fat content is indicated on the label, according to Government speciﬁcations. Edam is made also in the United States.

Edam has a pleasingly mild, clean, sometimes salty, ﬂavor and a rather
ﬁrm and crumbly body, free of holes and openings. It usually is shaped
like a ﬂattened ball, but in the United States it is made also in a loaf shape.
The cheeses usually weigh from to 4 5/2 pounds but sometimes weigh as
much as 14 pounds. In the United States, they sometimes weigh only
about % to 1 pound.

High-quality milk should be used in making Edam; if the milk is pasteurized, as is common in the United States, lactic starter is added. Color
may be added and the milk is set with rennet extract. About 15 minutes
later the curd is cut into %-inch cubes, then stirred and heated to a temperature of 90° to 95° F. When the curd is suViciently ﬁrm, part of the
whey is drained oV. When enough whey has drained so that the curd is
exposed, the curd is pushed to the side of the vat and more whey pressed
out. The curd is stirred and may be salted. The temperature of the curd
should be at least 88° when it is put into the molds for pressing.

Special pressing molds, preferably metal but sometimes hardwood and
lined with cheesecloth, are used. Each has a round lower section about
6 inches deep and 6 inches in diameter, with holes in the bottom for drainage, and a round cover. In the United States the cheese sometimes is
pressed in rectangular loaf -shaped molds.

The molds are ﬁlled with curd, covered, and then pressed for about 30

oV. Sometimes the curd is enclosed in cloth on which a board and weight
are placed, to hasten drainage. The curd is kneaded to further expel whey.
Then salt and sometimes sweet cream are mixed with the curd, and it is
molded into various .sizes and shapes. The cheese usually is consumed
locally, either while fresh or after curing.

In the United States, Farm cheese, which is known also as Farmer cheese
and Pressed cheese and, erroneously, as Cream cheese, is a ﬁrm, pressed
cheese made on farms. There is considerable variation in the cheese because
the method of making diVers in diVerent localities and may not be uniform
on all farms in one locality. Usually whole milk is used, but sometimes the
milk is partly skimmed. Starter (which may be buttermilk of good ﬂavor)
is added to the milk at room temperature or at a temperature as high as
86° F. Rennet may be added, or the milk may be coagulated by souring.
The coagulation period may be as long as 5 or 6 hours, or overnight. The
curd is cut into coarse particles and stirred, and it may be heated to about
90°. The whey is drained oV and the curd is stirred and salted. Then the
curd is placed in bags or in cloth-lined metal hoops and pressed overnight.
The next morning the cheese is removed from the bag or hoop and wrapped
in parchment if it is to be eaten without much curing. If it is to be cured,
the pressed cheese is dried and then coated by dipping in hot paraVin. It is
cured in a moist cellar at a temperature not over 60°. The cheese should
have a clean, mild ﬂavor and should slice without crumbling. The yield is
about 10 pounds per 100 pounds of whole milk and about 9 pounds per
100 pounds of partly-skimmed milk.

What information is available about Gammelost?,"Gammelost, made from sour skim milk in Norway (principally in the
counties of Hardanger and Sogn), is a semisoft, blue-mold, ripened table
cheese, with a rather sharp, aromatic ﬂavor. The principal ripening molds
are species of Mucor, Rhizopus, and Penicillium. The rind is brownish
and the interior is brownish-yellow with a blue-green tint; the color darkens
with age. The cheese is round and ﬂat, usually about 6 inches in diameter,
and from 5 to 6 inches thick. It weighs usually between 6 and 9 pounds,
although some cheeses may weigh more than 25 pounds. The cheese is
made by one method in Hardanger and by a slightly diVerent method in
Sogn.

In the Hardanger method, about 0.5 percent of lactic starter is added
to skim milk and, after souring for a day or two at 66° F., it is put into a
vat and warmed slowly to 145°. After about 30 minutes at that temperature, the curd is dipped into cloth bags and pressed heavily. After pressing, the curd is removed from the bags, broken up, and packed in clothlined forms which then are covered and placed in boiling whey for 3/ 2
hours. This practically sterilizes the cheese and changes its texture. The
next day the cheese is removed from the forms and put in a warm place
for a day or two to dry, after which it is pierced with metal needles that
have been inoculated with a mold — Penicillium roquejorti, or a related
species — that develops a greenish-blue mold throughout the cheese. It is
then placed on shelves in a curing room which is maintained at a temperature of 50° to 55° and a relative humidity of 90 percent. A Mucor, which
is propagated by handrubbing the surface with mycelium from older cheeses,
develops on the surface of the cheese. The cheese is inverted daily or at
least every other day, and rubbed or cleaned if necessary. The curing

period is about 4 weeks or somewhat longer.

In the Sogn method, V/z to 2 percent of starter is added to the skim
milk, and it is soured at a temperature of 72° to 75° F.; on the second day,
the milk may be transferred to the cheese vat where souring is completed
at a temperature of 77°. When the milk has reached the desired stage of
souring (a later stage than in the Hardanger method), it is heated slowly
to the boiling point. The whey is removed, and the curd is heated to
about 195°, then placed in forms to drain. The forms are covered with
cloths and kept in a warm place. After the whey has drained oV, the curd
is removed from the forms, crumbled ﬁne, inoculated with mold, and
repressed. The next day the cheeses are removed from the forms, dried
in a warm place for 4 or 5 days, and then taken to the curing room. The
curing process is the same as in the Hardanger method.

In both methods, after the cheese is partly cured, it may be put in chests

What information is available about Gorgonzola?,"Gorgonzola, known also as Straechino di Gorgonzola, is the principal
blue-green veined cheese of Italy. It is said to have been made in the
Po Valley since 879 A. D. It is named for the village of Gorgonzola, near
Milan, but very little is made there now. It is made chieﬂy in Lombardy,
where its manufacture is an important industry, and in Piedmont. It
formerly was made during September and October, because winter conditions are favorable for curing; however curing caves have been built
in cliVs in the Alps, especially near Lecco, and it is now made throughout
the year. It is made also in numerous other countries; in the United
States it is made mostly in Wisconsin and Michigan.

The interior of the cheese is mottled with blue-green veins like those
in Roquefort. In Italy the mold is called Penicillium glaucum rather than
P. roqueforti — the name used in the United States — but it is the same
mold, at least in some instances. The surface of the cheese formerly was
protected by covering it with a reddish coat resembling clay, which is
prepared from barite or brick dust, lard or tallow, and coloring matter.
Now, however, tinfoil and stout containers are used. The cheeses, which
are cylindrical and ﬂat, are from 8/ 2 to 11 inches in diameter and from
6/ 2 to 8 inches thick, and weigh between 14 and 17 pounds.

Evening milk is warmed to 86° F., or sometimes 90°, and enough rennet
added to coagulate it in 15 to 20 minutes. The curd is cut slowly, allowed to
settle, collected in a cloth, and hung up to drain overnight in a room in

which the temperature is between 60° and 68°. Curd is prepared similarly
from morning milk and is drained but not cooled. Expandable wooden
hoops, 8 to 12 inches in diameter and 10/ 2 to 12 inches deep, are lined with
cloth and placed on rye straw or drain mats on a drain table. The two lots
of curd are cut into rather large slices or portions, and mold powder is
sprinkled in as the portions are placed alternately in the hoops. The warm
(morning) curd is placed mainly in the bottom and at the periphery and
piled up on top, with the cool (evening) curd between. This distribution
of the curd is considered a critical part of the making process. It aids in
developing mechanical openings in the interior of the cheese and in binding
the surface and making it smooth. The piled-up curd is covered with the
edges of the cloth lining, and the cheese is turned. It is repressed and
turned every 2 hours at ﬁrst and less frequently thereafter for a day. Then
the cloth is removed and the cheese is replaced in the hoops, left on the straw
or drain mat, and turned twice daily for several days. It is salted with dry
salt, heavily at ﬁrst and lightly later, a total of 8 to 12 times in from 1 to 3
weeks. The temperature of the room is held at 50° or a little higher.

The cheese is dried and initial curing takes place in a room in which the
temperature is between 52° and 60° F., and the relative humidity is 75
to 80 percent. During this period — 20 to 30 days — the cheese is turned
and rubbed by hand every other day and kept clean. It is scraped with a
knife occasionally.

The cheese then is moved to a room in which the temperature is from
48° to 50° F., and the relative humidity 85 to 90 percent, where the second
stage of curing takes place. This period lasts 2 months. If the cheese was
not punched earlier, it is punched at this stage (see Roquefort) .

Final curing takes place in a room in which the temperature is from
40° to 43° F., and the relative humidity is even higher than in the other
curing rooms. The entire curing period is at least 90 days, frequently is
6 months, and may be a year.

The yield is 13 to 15 pounds of fresh cheese, or 10 to 12 pounds of cured
cheese, per 100 pounds of milk.

What information is available about Gouda?,"Gouda, ﬁrst made in the vicinity of Gouda in the Province of South
Holland, Netherlands, is a semisoft to hard, sweet-curd cheese similar to
Edam except that it contains more fat. It is made from whole or partly

skimmed cow's milk, but skimmed less than milk used in making Edam.
Gouda usually is shaped like a ﬂattened sphere and pressed in molds with
rounded ends. The molds vary in size but usually are nearly 14 inches in
diameter and 4*/2 to 5 inches deep. The cheeses usually weigh between
10 and 25 pounds but may weigh as little as 6 or as much as 50 pounds.
Gouda is made also in a loaf weighing about 8 pounds. A so-called ""baby
Gouda"" is oval, weighs a pound or slightly less, may be coated with red
wax, and wrapped in a cellophane-type wrapper. The red surface is not
necessarily an identifying characteristic, however, as it is of domestic and
imported Edam.

Gouda is made in much the same way as Edam. (See Edam.) Some
slight modiﬁcations in the details of manufacture are mentioned here.
Although the milk may be set at any temperature between 84° and 90° F.,
it usually is set at 90°. After the curd is cut, the whey is drained oV,
heated, and poured back into the vat. This procedure is repeated once or
twice, in order to increase the temperature of the curd to between 100° and
106°. Other factors being equal, cheese made from curd heated to the
higher temperatures (within this range) will have a ﬁrmer body, will cure
more slowly, and will have better keeping quality. Some salt is added to
the curd before it is put into the hoops (molds) for pressing. Salting is
usually completed by immersing the cheese in a salt solution; however, it
may be completed in the curing room by rubbing dry salt on the cheese
daily for 7 to 10 days. The cheese cures in 2 to 3 months, but it improves
in ﬂavor if it is cured for 5 to 6 months.

is broken up or cut, stirred, and heated slowly to a temperature of about
120° F. It is held at this temperature for about 3 hours, and stirred for
the ﬁrst hour. At the end of the heating period, the curd is put in cloths
or in forms, while the whey drains either with or without pressure. Then
the curd is either mixed thoroughly or ground in a curd mill, and salted.
Sometimes caraway seed is added. The cheeses then are molded by hand,
or pressed in small forms, into the desired shape. They are dried in a
warm room and then placed on shelves in a cool, moist cellar to cure.
The cheeses are kept clean while curing. When surface ripening has
begun, they are wrapped and packed in boxes. They are cured for 6 to
8 weeks at a temperature no higher than 50°. At higher temperatures
they cure too rapidly. Well-ripened Hand cheese has a very sharp,
pungent ﬂavor and aroma; the consumer sometimes must become
accustomed to it before he ﬁnds it agreeable.

CHEESE VARIETIES AND DESCRIPTIONS

57

In the United States^ cheese of this type is made by farm families of
German descent in Pennsylvania and in a few factories in New York,
Wisconsin, and northern Illinois. The curd is prepared in much the same
way as Cottage-cheese curd, either with or without rennet. The drained
curd is salted and either molded by hand or pressed in forms into cakes
2 to 3 inches in diameter and less than an inch thick. The cheeses then are
cured in a cool, moist room. Action of bacteria, yeasts, and molds causes
surface ripening, and a smear usually appears. Regulation of the temperature and humidity in the curing room is essential to control surface
ripening; it is controlled also by frequent rubbing or washing of the cheese.

Queso de mano (Hand cheese) is a sour-milk, cooked-curd, small, round
cheese made in small quantities in Venezuela and some other LatinAmerican countries for local consumption. Uusually it is made from
cow's milk, but it is said to be made also from goat's milk. The cheeses
are 6 or 7 inches in diameter.

Harzkase is a type of Hand cheese made in Germany. It usually is
about 2 inches in diameter, from ^2 to 54 inch thick, and weighs about
4 ounces. (See Hand cheese.)

bot:Hand cheese, a small, sour-milk, surface-ripened cheese, is so named
because originally is was molded in ﬁnal shape by hand, and still is in some
parts of Europe. It is very popular among Germanic peoples and is made
in several countries. There are many local names for Hand cheese, among
which are the following: In Germany — Mainzer Handkase or Harzkase,
Alte Kuhkase, or Berliner Kuhkase, Ihlefeld, Satz, and Thuringia Caraway
cheese; in Austria— Olmutzer Quargeln and Olmutzer Bierkase; and in
Russia— Livlander. Some of these are described under their particular
names.

The method of making Hand cheese diVers in diVerent localities.
Following is a general description: Buttermilk or lactic starter is added
to skim milk, which is then coagulated at room temperature. The curd
is broken up or cut, stirred, and heated slowly to a temperature of about
120° F. It is held at this temperature for about 3 hours, and stirred for
the ﬁrst hour. At the end of the heating period, the curd is put in cloths
or in forms, while the whey drains either with or without pressure. Then
the curd is either mixed thoroughly or ground in a curd mill, and salted.
Sometimes caraway seed is added. The cheeses then are molded by hand,

It is about 10 inches in diameter and 2 or 3 inches thick.

The milk is set with rennet at a temperature of 80° to 85° F. In about
an hour the curd is cut and the whey is removed. The curd is pressed to
remove more whey after which it is pressed by hand into molds. After
draining for about 2 days, it is put in the drying room for about 3 weeks.
Then it is taken to the curing cellar and buried in hay, where it remains for
6 weeks to 3 months. The cheese is then ready for sale; most of it is con-

and the soft Provole or Provatura, Scamorze, Mozzarella, Manteca, and
Trecce.

Swiss-type cheeses made in Italy include Sbrinz or Spalen, Fribourg,
Battelmatt, Montasio, Fontina, Bitto, and Urseren. Other hard cheeses are
Romano, Sardo, Incanestrato, Asiago, Pepato, Bra, and Cotronese.

The Italian blue-green veined cheeses are Gorgonzola and similar cheeses,
including Gex, Pannarone, Sassenage, Septmoncel, and Moncenisio.

The principal soft cheeses are Bel Paese, Crescenza, Cacio ﬁore, Raviggiolo, Robbiole, Robbiolini, Reblochon, Mascarpone, Formagelle, Formaggio crema, Mont d'Or, Montpellier, Milano or Quartirolo, and Bernarde.
Fresh Ricotta, which is made from coagulated whey protein, usually with
5 to 10 percent of whole or skim milk added, is another soft cheese.

Formaggio and cacio mean cheese. Stracchino, which refers to a condition of milk for making cheese, has come to mean soft, rich, ripened cheese
in northern Italy.

Pecorino, used with the name of a cheese, indicates that it was made from
ewe's milk (as Pecorino Romano) ; Gaprino, that it was made from goat's
milk ; and Vacchino, that it was made from cow's milk.

The names of some Italian cheeses indicate the season in which they are
made. Maggengo refers to cheese made between April and September,

salted, put into a cloth, and again pressed for 12 hours. During this period
the pressure is increased gradually, and the cheese is turned occasionally
and put into a fresh, dry cloth. The cheese is then put into a salt bath,
for 40 to 48 hours, after which it is transferred to the curing cellar where
it is cured for about 4 months. During the curing period it is wiped with
a dry cloth every day for about a week and thereafter twice a week. The
cured cheese has small eyes. It is cylindrical, from 10 to 12 inches in
diameter and from 4 to 6 inches thick, and weighs from 15 to 25 pounds."

What information is available about Leicester?,"Leicester cheese, ﬁrst made in Leicester County in the midlands of England, is a hard, mild cheese made from cow's whole milk. It is said that at
one time Leicester was the ﬁnest cheese made in England, with the possible
exception of Stilton. It resembles Cheddar, but has more color and a higher
moisture content and ripens more rapidly; it is also similar to Derby and

Cheshire. The cheeses are about 18 inches in diameter and 6 inches thick,
and weigh about 40 pounds.

A mixture of evening and morning milk is colored with annatto. Lactic
starter and rennet are added at a temperature of 80° to 84° F. in winter
and 76° to 78° in summer. About 75 minutes later, when the curd is very
ﬁrm, it is cut with a curd breaker or %-inch curd knives. It is stirred carefully for a few minutes, then heated to a temperature of 92° in 45 minutes,
stirred about 10 minutes longer, and then the whey is drained oV. A
curd rack is laid on the curd and weighted, to expel whey. The lightly
pressed, matted curd then is cut into 6-inch blocks. The blocks of curd
are piled on a rack in a vat and covered with a cloth to keep them from
cooling. The curd is cut into smaller pieces and inverted at 20-minute
intervals, until it acquires the desired acidity and ﬁrmness, when it is milled.
Salt is added at the rate of about 2 pounds per 100 pounds of curd, and
the curd is then transferred to forms and pressed. A few hours later, the
cheese is removed from the forms, dressed in cloth, and repressed with
gradually increasing pressure until a ﬁnal pressure of about a ton is used.
After the cheese has been in press a day or more, it is salted again with dry
salt and then is transferred to the curing room where it is cured on shelves
at a temperature of approximately 60°. It may be marketed after curing
for about 2 months, but usually it is cured for 6 to 8 months and it may be
cured for as long as a year.

and it is warmed in a vat or kettle to a temperature usually between 86°
and 92° F., but in some factories to as high as 96°. Lactic starter and
rennet are added. Usually about 30 minutes after setting, but in some
factories an hour later, the curd is cut into cubes about / 2 inch in diameter.
If the milk was set at the lower temperatures, the curd is stirred slowly
as it is warmed to about 96°, and it is stirred gently at intervals as it
acquires ﬁrmness. When the curd is suViciently ﬁrm, most of the whey
is drained oV. In some factories, the curd is washed with weak salt brine
to lower its acidity.

The curd is dipped into large rectangular metal or wooden forms that
rest on a drain table. Sometimes the forms are divided into sections the
size of the individual cheeses; sometimes the forms are not divided, and
after the block of curd is removed from the forms, it is divided to make
the individual cheeses. In some factories, a light-weight board is placed
on the curd to furnish light pressure. The forms of curd are turned
frequently.

When the cheeses are ﬁrm enough to retain their shape, they are removed
from the forms and salted. In some factories, they are packed close
together in dry salt on a salting table for at least a day, and they are
turned frequently until they have absorbed salt on all surfaces; in other

factories, they are rubbed with salt daily for about 3 days; and in still
other factories, they are immersed in salt brine for a day at a temperature
of 35° to 60° F..

After the cheeses are salted, they are cured on shelves at a temperature
of 50° to 60° F. and a relative humidity of about 90 percent. According
to some authorities, surface-ripening micro-organisms are responsible for
the characteristic ﬂavor and aroma. Yeasts, which reduce the acidity, predominate at ﬁrst, and these are followed by Bacterium linens, which
produces a characteristic reddish-yellow pigment.

The cheeses are placed close together on the shelves at ﬁrst, and separated
later. As the cheese cures, slime forms on the surface and the rind acquires
a reddish-yellow color. In some factories, the cheeses are rubbed and
turned every 2 or 3 days; in other factories, they are washed with salty
water. The older cheeses are rubbed or washed before the younger ones;
in this way, the younger ones are inoculated with the surface-ripening
micro-organisms. After they have cured for 2 or 3 weeks, they are wrapped
in parchment or waxed paper and an outer layer of metal foil, and curing

period may be as long as 3 hours. When the curd has settled, the whey is
drained oV and the curd is transferred to cylindrical, perforated, clothlined forms; it is turned frequently for a period of several hours. Then
the cheeses are removed from the forms and dried for 3 or 4 days. When
dry, they are salted on the surface and transferred to a cool, moist cellar
where they are cured for 3 to 6 weeks. While curing, they are washed every
few days with warm water or warm, salty water; and a reddish-yellow
smear develops on the surface. The cheeses are wrapped separately, and
they are shipped in wooden containers called schachteln.","human:What information is available about Moncenisio?

curd is cut very carefully to the size of peas and is heated gradually (in
about 30 minutes) to a temperature of 120°. Then heating is stopped, but
the curd is stirred for another 30 to 40 minutes. Some of the whey is
dipped from the kettle, and a cloth is used to remove the curd. The cheese
is pressed for 24 hours, during which time it is turned frequently. From
2/2 to 3 percent of salt is added over a period of about a month. After
salting is completed, the cheese is taken to a well-ventilated room to dry.
While drying, it is turned frequently and rubbed to keep the surface free
of mold. When dry it is scraped carefully and is then taken to the curing

cellar, where it is rubbed frequently with a coarse cloth. When the rind
has become ﬁrm, olive oil usually is applied. Sometimes the rind is blackened with soot.

Considerable Mozzarella is made in the United States, especially in
New York. The milk is set with rennet at a temperature of 86° to 88° F.

curd is cut and it is put into bags to drain. It is common practice to ship
the curd to a dealer at this stage, as is done with cottage-cheese curd. The
dealer stores the curd until he is ready to market the cheese. Then he
completes the manufacturing process (heating and kneading the curd in

What information is available about Miinster?,"Minister (or Muenster) is a semisoft, whole-milk cheese that was ﬁrst
made in the vicinity of Miinster in the Vosges Mountains near the western
border of Germany. It is similar to Brick cheese but has less surface smear
and undergoes less surface ripening while curing. It contains numerous
small mechanical openings. Gerome (or Gerardmer), which is made in
nearby France, is similar.

The cheeses usually are cylindrical and ﬂat, about 7 inches in diameter
and from 2 to 7 inches thick. Those 2 inches thick weigh about 2 pounds ;
those 7 inches thick weigh as much as 10 pounds. Usually they are 4 to
5 inches thick and weigh between 4 and 6 pounds. In some factories the
cheeses are made in loaf shape.

Good-quality milk is essential in making Miinster. In the United States,
the milk is pasteurized. Lactic starter is added, and annatto color may be
added. The milk is warmed to a temperature of 86° to 90° F., and rennet
is added. From 30 to 40 minutes later the curd is cut into pieces about
*/2 inch in diameter; then it is stirred and heated. (In Europe, the time
from setting to cutting may be as long as 2 hours; the curd is left undis-

turbed in the whey for 30 to 45 minutes after it is cut, and it is not heated.)

When the curd is suViciently ﬁrm, the whey is drained oV, sometimes
caraway seed is mixed with the curd, and it is dipped into perforated
cloth-lined metal forms. The forms are in two parts, which ﬁt together.

The forms of curd are turned and the cloths are changed several times
the ﬁrst day; usually at the end of the ﬁrst day, the upper half of each
form and the cloth lining are removed. The curd remains in the lower
half of the forms for 3 or 4 days and is turned twice daily. Then the
cheeses are removed from the forms and salted. Usually they are rubbed
with salt daily for 2 or 3 days; if necessary, they are replaced in the forms
between saltings until they are ﬁrm enough to retain their shape. In some
factories, they are salted in brine.

The cheeses are dried, then cured at a temperature of 50° to 55° F.
and a relative humidity of about 75 percent. They are turned and cleaned
at least twice a week. In some factories they are washed with salty water;
in others, they are washed with water and rubbed lightly with salt. Sometimes they are rubbed with vegetable oil. In the United States they usually
are cured for 6 to 8 weeks, but frequently are sold after ripening only a
week or two; in Europe they are cured for as long as 3 months. The cheeses
are wrapped in parchment or waxed paper and packed in boxes. From
10 to 12 pounds of cheese is obtained from 100 pounds of whole milk.

Analysis: Moisture, not more than 46 percent (usually 42 to 44 percent) ;
fat, 28 to 29.6 percent (not less than 50 percent in the solids) ; and salt, 1.8
to 2 percent.

Mysost

Mysost cheese is made in the Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden,
and Denmark) and in a few factories in the United States, principally in
northern Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Wisconsin, from the whey
obtained in the manufacture of other cheeses. There is considerable

82 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

variation in the composition of the whey used in diVerent factories and in
diVerent localities, and in the manufacturing procedure and the composition
of the cheese; and it is known by diVerent local names. Mysost is made
from cow's-milk whey. Similar cheese made from goat's-milk whey is
called Gjetost. In some instances a small proportion, usually not more
than 10 percent, of buttermilk or whole milk, or even cream is added to the
whey. Cheese made from such whey contains more fat and is softer and
sometimes is called Primost or F10tost. Cheese made by the same method
from whole milk rather than whey is called Gomost.

The cheese consists principally of caramelized lactose (milk sugar) but
contains also the fat, protein, and minerals present in the whey. It is
light brown in color, has a buttery consistency and a mild, sweetish ﬂavor.
It does not undergo appreciable ripening but keeps well when packaged

properly.

Sometimes, if the whey contains considerable acid, neutralizer is added
to prevent a sour or bitter ﬂavor in the cheese. If sweet whey is used,
lactic starter usually is added. The whey is strained into a kettle and
boiled (condensed) until it is a viscous mass, which may take 5 hours or
longer. It is stirred while boiling. The albuminous material that rises
to the surface is skimmed oV. When the whey is reduced to about onefourth its original volume and has the consistency of heavy cream, the
albumin skimmed oV earlier is stirred in thoroughly. Some manufacturers
also stir in as much as 10 percent of brown sugar and some add spices, such
as cloves or cumin seed. Then, while hot, it is poured or dipped into a
round tank or vat equipped with a stirrer, and, while cooling, it is stirred
constantly to prevent the formation of lactose crystals. When cool, it is
poured into greased round or rectangular forms. When hard (ﬁrm), the
cheeses usually but not always are cut into pie-shaped or small rectangular
segments. Then, the whole cheese or, if cut, the individual segments
may be dipped in wax or paraVin, and they are wrapped tightly, preferably
in metal foil, to prevent contamination, and packed in cartons. The ﬂat,
cylindrical cheeses frequently weigh about 18 pounds.

Analysis: Moisture, frequently about 13 percent and preferably not more
than 18 percent; fat in the solids, frequently 10 to 20 percent but preferably
not less than 33 percent.","human:What information is available about Miinster?

caraway seed is mixed with the curd, and it is dipped into perforated
cloth-lined metal forms. The forms are in two parts, which ﬁt together.

The forms of curd are turned and the cloths are changed several times
the ﬁrst day; usually at the end of the ﬁrst day, the upper half of each
form and the cloth lining are removed. The curd remains in the lower
half of the forms for 3 or 4 days and is turned twice daily. Then the
cheeses are removed from the forms and salted. Usually they are rubbed
with salt daily for 2 or 3 days; if necessary, they are replaced in the forms
between saltings until they are ﬁrm enough to retain their shape. In some
factories, they are salted in brine.

The cheeses are dried, then cured at a temperature of 50° to 55° F.
and a relative humidity of about 75 percent. They are turned and cleaned
at least twice a week. In some factories they are washed with salty water;
in others, they are washed with water and rubbed lightly with salt. Sometimes they are rubbed with vegetable oil. In the United States they usually
are cured for 6 to 8 weeks, but frequently are sold after ripening only a
week or two; in Europe they are cured for as long as 3 months. The cheeses
are wrapped in parchment or waxed paper and packed in boxes. From
10 to 12 pounds of cheese is obtained from 100 pounds of whole milk.

Analysis: Moisture, not more than 46 percent (usually 42 to 44 percent) ;
fat, 28 to 29.6 percent (not less than 50 percent in the solids) ; and salt, 1.8

Mysost

Mysost cheese is made in the Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden,
and Denmark) and in a few factories in the United States, principally in
northern Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Wisconsin, from the whey
obtained in the manufacture of other cheeses. There is considerable

82 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

variation in the composition of the whey used in diVerent factories and in
diVerent localities, and in the manufacturing procedure and the composition
of the cheese; and it is known by diVerent local names. Mysost is made
from cow's-milk whey. Similar cheese made from goat's-milk whey is
called Gjetost. In some instances a small proportion, usually not more
than 10 percent, of buttermilk or whole milk, or even cream is added to the
whey. Cheese made from such whey contains more fat and is softer and
sometimes is called Primost or F10tost. Cheese made by the same method
from whole milk rather than whey is called Gomost.

The cheese consists principally of caramelized lactose (milk sugar) but
contains also the fat, protein, and minerals present in the whey. It is
light brown in color, has a buttery consistency and a mild, sweetish ﬂavor.
It does not undergo appreciable ripening but keeps well when packaged

properly.

Sometimes, if the whey contains considerable acid, neutralizer is added
to prevent a sour or bitter ﬂavor in the cheese. If sweet whey is used,
lactic starter usually is added. The whey is strained into a kettle and
boiled (condensed) until it is a viscous mass, which may take 5 hours or
longer. It is stirred while boiling. The albuminous material that rises
to the surface is skimmed oV. When the whey is reduced to about onefourth its original volume and has the consistency of heavy cream, the
albumin skimmed oV earlier is stirred in thoroughly. Some manufacturers
also stir in as much as 10 percent of brown sugar and some add spices, such
as cloves or cumin seed. Then, while hot, it is poured or dipped into a
round tank or vat equipped with a stirrer, and, while cooling, it is stirred
constantly to prevent the formation of lactose crystals. When cool, it is
poured into greased round or rectangular forms. When hard (ﬁrm), the
cheeses usually but not always are cut into pie-shaped or small rectangular
segments. Then, the whole cheese or, if cut, the individual segments
may be dipped in wax or paraVin, and they are wrapped tightly, preferably
in metal foil, to prevent contamination, and packed in cartons. The ﬂat,
cylindrical cheeses frequently weigh about 18 pounds.

Analysis: Moisture, frequently about 13 percent and preferably not more
than 18 percent; fat in the solids, frequently 10 to 20 percent but preferably
not less than 33 percent."

Olivet

Olivet, a soft, cow's-milk cheese, undoubtedly is named for Olivet, in
the Department of Loiret, France, the center of manufacture.

There are three types of Olivet : ( 1 ) Unripened, made from whole milk,
sometimes with cream added. This is consumed as fresh, summer, white,
or cream cheese. (2) Half-ripened or blue, made from whole or partly
skimmed milk. This is the most common type. (3) Ripened, also made
from whole or partly skimmed milk.

The curd is made by a process similar to that used in making Camembert.
Rennet is added to the milk, and after a coagulation period of about 2 hours
the curd is transferred to a container that is perforated on the sides and
bottom to facilitate drainage of the whey. About 24 hours later, the curd
is put into forms, and pressed. The cheeses are turned and salted the next
day, and they are then ready for consumption as unripened (fresh) cheese.

If half -ripened (blue) Olivet is being made, on the day following salting,
the cheeses are placed on straw-covered shelves in the ﬁrst curing room,
which is maintained at a temperature of about 65° F. A reddish tint
appears on the surface in a few days, and this is soon followed by a bluish
tint. The blue color appears in from 10 to 15 days in summer and in about
a month in winter. It is a sign of maturity, and the cheeses then are
ready for consumption as half-ripened (blue) cheese. When cared for
properly, this type keeps for several months.

If ripened Olivet is being made, when the blue color appears the cheeses
are transferred to a second curing room where ripening is continued for an
additional 15 to 30 days. Sometimes they are covered with ashes, which is
believed to hasten the ripening process.

What information is available about Parmesan?,"Parmesan is the name in common use outside of Italy, and sometimes in
Italy, for a group of very hard cheeses that have been made and known in
that country for centuries as Grana. Included in the group are Parmigiano,
Reggiano, Lodigiano, Lombardy, Emiliano, Veneto or Venezza, and
Bagozzo or Bresciano. They diVer in size and shape and in the extent to
which the milk is skimmed, and there are slight diVerences in the methods
of manufacture. This type of cheese was ﬁrst made in the vicinity of Parma,
in Emilia, hence the name; its manufacture has spread to other parts of
Italy and to other countries. It is made mostly from April to November.
Following is a general description of the process of making Parmesan-type
cheese:

Cow's milk, which is skimmed more or less in diVerent localities and in
diVerent seasons, is warmed to a temperature between 90° and 98° F., in
copper kettles that hold as much as 1,600 pounds, and a starter containing

heat-resistant lactobacilli and Streptococcus thermophilus is added. Cheese
color may be added. Enough rennet extract, diluted in water, is added
to produce curd ﬁrm enough to cut in 20 to 30 minutes. Then the
curd is cut with a so-called cheese harp; cutting and stirring are continued
until the particles of curd are Ys to % 6 inch in diameter and are uniform
in size. The curd is heated in 35 to 50 minutes, with stirring, to a temperature of 115° to 125°, or as high as 130° if necessary to ﬁrm the curd
suViciently.

When the curd is suViciently ﬁrm, stirring is discontinued and the curd
is allowed to settle for about 10 minutes. It may be pressed in the bottom

88 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK,, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

of the kettle with a curd presser, then lifted with a scoop as a cloth is placed
under it; or it may be dipped into a cloth like that used in dipping Swiss.
The curd in the cloth is lifted and hung up to drain for 20 to 40 minutes;
then it is placed in a hoop on a drain table. The hoop is 18 or more inches
in diameter and up to 10 inches deep. The cloth is folded over the curd;
a circular board is placed on top, and pressure is applied. The cloth is
changed and the cheese is turned four or ﬁve times, frequently at ﬁrst and
then at longer intervals; then the cloth is removed and the pressure is
increased. The cheese remains under pressure in the hoop for 18 to 20
hours. It is then taken to the salting room, which is maintained at a temperature of 60° to 65° F., where it may be left in the hoop for about 3 days.
Then it is removed from the hoop and salted in brine for 12 or 15 days, or as

long as 20 days, depending on the size of the cheese. It is dried for 8 to 10
days, usually on shelves but sometimes in the sun.

It is cured on shelves for about a year (the ﬁrst stage of curing) in a
room which usually is a few degrees cooler than the salting room and which
has a relative humidity of 80 to 85 percent. The cheese is turned frequently
and is kept clean by washing and scraping; it is rubbed with oil from time
to time, and dark coloring may be rubbed on the surface. In the second
stage of curing, it usually is held by dealers in large curing rooms, at a
temperature of 54° to 60° F. and a relative humidity as high as 90 percent.
It may be coated with a mixture of burnt umber, lamp black, and dextrin,
dispersed in wine or grapeseed oil.

The yield of cheese cured for 4 months is 5 to 6 pounds per 100 pounds
of partly skimmed milk.

Fully cured Parmesan is very hard but keeps almost indeﬁnitely. It can
be grated easily, and is used as grated cheese on salads and soups, and with
macaroni. Considerable quantities are imported into the United States for
use as grated cheese. However, successful domestic production, largely in
Wisconsin and Michigan, is displacing the imported product to some
extent. In the United States, Parmesan is cured for at least 14 months.

the making process and also in the ﬁnished cheese. In making Pont
l'ﬁveque, the milk is set at a higher temperature; the coagulation, draining,
and curing periods are shorter; the cheeses are washed while curing; and
there is less development of surface mold. When cured, Pont Pﬁveque has
a ﬁrmer body and is a yellower color.

St. Remy cheese, which is made in the Department of Haute-Saone,
France, is very much like Pont l'ﬁveque; and Brioler, Steinbuscher, and
Woriener are German cheeses that are similar to Pont l'ﬁveque but milder.

Pont TEveque is made usually from cow's milk, either whole or slightly
skimmed; preferably the milk should contain at least 3.7 percent of fat.
Usually cheese color and lactic starter are added to the milk, which is
warmed to a temperature of 90° to 95° F. Enough rennet is added so
the curd will be ready to cut in 35 to 40 minutes. After the curd is cut and
has settled, it is transferred to a cloth, which is spread on a drain rack, and
it is covered to retard cooling. When the whey has drained oV and the

bot:Pont r£veque

Pont P£veque, a soft cheese similar to Romadur, is manufactured in the
vicinity of Pont l'ﬁveque, in the Department of Calvados (Normandy),
France. It is mold-ripened like Camembert, but there are diVerences in
the making process and also in the ﬁnished cheese. In making Pont
l'ﬁveque, the milk is set at a higher temperature; the coagulation, draining,
and curing periods are shorter; the cheeses are washed while curing; and
there is less development of surface mold. When cured, Pont Pﬁveque has
a ﬁrmer body and is a yellower color.

St. Remy cheese, which is made in the Department of Haute-Saone,
France, is very much like Pont l'ﬁveque; and Brioler, Steinbuscher, and
Woriener are German cheeses that are similar to Pont l'ﬁveque but milder.

Pont TEveque is made usually from cow's milk, either whole or slightly
skimmed; preferably the milk should contain at least 3.7 percent of fat.
Usually cheese color and lactic starter are added to the milk, which is
warmed to a temperature of 90° to 95° F. Enough rennet is added so
the curd will be ready to cut in 35 to 40 minutes. After the curd is cut and
has settled, it is transferred to a cloth, which is spread on a drain rack, and
it is covered to retard cooling. When the whey has drained oV and the
curd is suViciently ﬁrm, it is put into square, perforated, metal forms, which
rest on straw mats on a drain board. The forms of curd are turned and
the mats are changed every 5 minutes for the ﬁrst half hour, and 5 or 6
times more during the ﬁrst day, and then less frequently. At the end of
the second or third day, the cheeses are removed from the forms and salted
on the surface with ﬁne, dry salt. Then they are placed in a well-ventilated
room to dry.

After several days in the drying room, the cheeses will be suViciently dry

What information is available about Port du Salut?,"Port du Salut (or Port Salut) cheese was ﬁrst made about 1865 by
Trappist Monks at the Abbey at Port du Salut, which is near Laval in the
Department of Mayenne, France. Its manufacture has spread to abbeys
in various parts of Europe, especially Austria, Czechoslovakia, and southern
Germany, and also to Canada and to the United States, where it is made
in at least one monastery in Kentucky. The Trappists have kept the exact
process secret, but similar cheese is made outside the monasteries in central
and southern Europe. In France, cheese of this type made outside the
monasteries is called St. Paulin.

The curd of Port du Salut cheese is compact and elastic, similar to
Pont Fﬁveque; the ﬂavor is similar to Gouda; and in some instances the
aroma is like very mild Limburger. The cheeses are cylindrical and ﬂat.
In France, they usually are 10 inches in diameter, nearly 2 inches thick, and
weigh about 5 pounds; in Austria (and Kentucky), they are about 7 inches
in diameter, 2 inches thick, and weigh nearly 3 pounds.

The details of the making process diVer in diVerent localities, but in
general are as follows :

Usually the cheese is made from cow's milk. Although the milk may be
partly skimmed, it is recommended that it contain not less than 3.5 percent
of fat. The milk is ripened slightly; or, if fresh milk is used, lactic starter
is added. Cheese color may be added. Rennet is added to the milk at

a temperature between 82° and 95° F. The coagulation period varies from
35 or 40 minutes to 60 or 80 minutes ; it is longer if fresh milk rather than
ripened milk is used, if rennet is added at a relatively low setting temperature, or if the curd is to be heated later.

The curd is cut carefully and stirred in much the same way as Swisscheese curd. Cutting and stirring is continued for 20 to 30 minutes. When
the curd particles are cut to Ys to *4 inch in diameter, part of the whey
is removed, and sometimes the curd is heated, with stirring, to a temperature
between 96° and 105° F., the ﬁnal temperature depending on the acidity
of the milk. Then, after the curd settles, much of the whey is removed.

94 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

The curd is stirred vigorously and then transferred rapidly to perforated,
cloth-lined metal forms, which are either 7 or 10 inches in diameter and
about 3 inches deep, and which rest on small drain boards. The curd
is heaped high in the forms and weighted with a disk. The curd remains
in the forms for 10 to 12 hours. The cheeses are turned and the cloths are
changed every 20 minutes the ﬁrst hour and less frequently thereafter.
Then the cheeses are removed from the forms, dried for about 20 hours,
and salted. Usually they are rubbed with dry salt and then placed in a
salt bath for a day. They are cured in a cellar on clean shelves for 6 to
8 weeks. Some authorities recommend curing at a temperature of 55° F.;
others recommend as high as 65°. Some recommend a relative humidity
of 85 or 90 percent, and according to others the room should be relatively

dry. At regular intervals during the curing period, the cheeses are washed
with salty water, wiped nearly dry, and turned. They are wrapped in
parchment and packed in boxes for marketing, and they may be marketed
before they are fully cured. Usually between 7 and 8 pounds of cured
cheese is obtained from 100 pounds of cow's milk, but the yield may be
as much as 9.5 pounds.

spices or ﬂavoring materials may be added. The cheese may be smoked,
or it may be made from smoked cheese, or so-called liquid smoke or smoke
""ﬂavor"" may be added.

Cheese was heated and preserved in cans in Germany and Switzerland
as early as 1895. Hard, ripened Process cheese was made in Switzerland in
1911. Canned Camembert cheese from Germany was marketed in the
United States as early as 1914, and the ﬁrst United States patent for
processing cheese was issued in 1916. It is estimated that at least one-third
of all cheese made in the United States, excepting the soft, unripened
cheeses, is marketed as Process cheese. American Cheddar cheese is processed in greatest quantities, but considerable quantities of other Americantype cheeses, such as Washed-curd, Colby, and Granular, and also Swiss,
Gruyere, Brick, Limburger, and others are processed. Most of this is

manufactured in a few large plants, as small-scale production is not practical.

Considerable skill is required in selecting the cheese to be used. It is
selected on the basis of ﬂavor, texture, body, age, acidity, and composition.
Desirable cheese ﬂavor is obtained by using sharp, fully-cured cheese, but
cheese with minor defects such as imperfect rind, pinholes, gassiness, and
open texture, as well as some mild ﬂavor defects can be used, as these defects
are either eliminated or minimized in processing.

Uniform composition, body, ﬂavor and texture in the ﬁnished cheese are
obtained by using cheese from two or more vat lots (in some instances as
many as 20 or 30 vat lots) in each batch or blend. A vat lot is the cheese
made from the milk in one vat.

The cheese for each batch is cleaned, cut if the cheeses are large, and run
through a grinder into a steam- jacketed kettle or a horizontal cooker. The
other ingredients are added either as the cheese is run through the grinder
or while it is being heated.

Steam- jacketed kettles, equipped with mechanical agitators to stir the
cheese, are available in various sizes but frequently hold from 200 to 400
pounds of cheese. As much as 30 minutes is required to heat the cheese in
a large kettle.

in from 3 to 5 minutes.

The cheese is heated to a temperature of at least 150° F., and usually
155° to 160°, and it is held at that temperature for at least 30 seconds but

from the batch with a spatula and the cheese is smooth, homogeneous,
glossy, and creamy, it is ready to be packaged. In most factories, it is packaged automatically by machine in cartons that hold from 8 ounces to 5
pounds. The cartons usually are lined with transparent ﬁlm, and they are
sealed to exclude air. The packaged cheese is cooled to room temperature;
then it is placed under refrigeration. The high temperature attained in
heating, together with the heat retained during the several hours required

What information is available about Provolone?,"Provolone, an Italian plastic-curd (pasta ﬁlata) cheese, was ﬁrst made
in southern Italy but is now also made in other parts of Italy and in the
United States, principally in Wisconsin and Michigan. It is light in color,
mellow, smooth, cuts without crumbling, and has an agreeable ﬂavor.

Provolone is made in various shapes and sizes, each of which is identiﬁed
by a more or less distinguishing name. Typically, the style called Provolone
is pear-shaped and in the United States weighs about 14 pounds; in Italy,
it weighs between 6 and 9 pounds and is called Provolone aVetale if it
weighs between 9 and 14 pounds. Larger styles, weighing as much as 50,
100, or 200 pounds, are called Provolone giganti. Smaller styles, weighing
from 1 to 5 pounds, usually are spherical and are called by various names
such as Provoletti, Provolotini, and Provoloncini. Another style is sausage-

98 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

shaped and is called Salame (Italian, sausage) if it weighs about 10 to 12
pounds, Salamini if it is smaller, and Salame giganti if it is larger (up to 200
pounds or more) .

The Italian method for making Provolone and Caciocavallo are almost
identical. ( See Caciocavallo. ) However, Provolone contains more fat and
the cheeses usually are smoked after they are salted and dried. After the
cheeses are smoked, they may be dipped in paraVin; if they are not parafﬁned, they are oiled. Although Caciocavallo may be used as a table cheese

after it has cured for 2 to 4 months, usually it is cured for longer periods
and is especially suitable for grating. On the other hand, Provolone is an
excellent table cheese after it has cured for 6 to 9 months, and the larger
styles are still suitable for use as table cheese after curing as long as 14
months. Sometimes the surface of the cheese is grooved, because it was
hung in strings or ropes or because it was molded in a grooved form. The
cheeses are kept clean while curing. The yield is 9*/ 2 to 10*/ 2 pounds of
uncured cheese, or 7j/ 2 to 8% pounds of cured cheese per 100 pounds of
milk.

The method for making Provolone in the United States diVers in some
respects from the Italian method. The milk, which may be either raw or
pasteurized, is put in a Cheddar-type vat and starter is added. The milk is
set with rennet paste or rennet extract plus an enzyme preparation. After
the curd is cut and the whey is removed, as in the Italian method, the curd
is matted, like Cheddar curd, and then cut into slabs about 2 by 8 by 24
inches which are worked and stretched in hot water. In some factories,
the curd is worked in a mixing machine. The machine, which holds about
500 pounds of curd, is a metal container equipped with an irregular-shaped
metal-rod stirrer, with paddle-like elbows, that revolves on a horizontal axis.
The water is added at a temperature of about 180° and usually is changed at
least once during the mixing process. The curd is worked for about 15
minutes and reaches a temperature of about 135°. Then the mass of curd —
now shiny, elastic, and stringy — is removed from the machine and cut into
pieces for the individual cheeses. These are treated further as described
under Caciocavallo. The yield of uncured cheese is from 9 to pounds
per 100 pounds of cow's milk from which very little of the fat has been
removed. If the cheese is made from raw milk, it must be cured at least

60 days.

Analysis (domestic Provolone) : Moisture, not more than 45 percent

What information is available about Queso Blanco?,"Queso Blanco (white cheese) is the principal Latin- American cheese.
It is made in a few small factories, but for the most part it is made on farms

is made from whole, partly skimmed, or skim milk ; or from whole milk with
cream or skim milk added. Much of the cheese is eaten fresh, within a day
or two after it is made, either without being pressed or after pressing. Some
of the pressed cheese is held for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 2 months
or more.

The method of making varies in the diVerent countries and on diVerent
farms in the same country, but in general is as follows:

100 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

Fresh, warm cow's milk is put into a wooden vat or tub, or in some
instances a hollowed-out log, and it is curdled with rennet, sometimes after

considerable acid has developed in the milk. After a coagulation period
of 30 to 45 minutes, the curd is broken up by hand and gently squeezed in
the whey until it is rather ﬁrm — usually for 15 to 30 minutes. When the
curd is suViciently ﬁrm, it is removed from the whey, broken up, kneaded,
and salted. Usually the salt is mixed with the curd, but it may be sprinkled
on the curd after it has been put in the forms. At this stage the curd is
fairly dry, soft, and granular, and has a salty ﬂavor.

If the curd is pressed, it often is worked with the hands before it is
put into the forms, to make it more pliable and plastic, and the cheese will
be more compact. The forms or cheese boxes are various sizes — usually
square or round, cloth-lined wooden frames with perforated bottoms. The
cloth liner is drawn up over the cheese and topped with a wooden cover,
which is weighted down with a heavy rock or lever press.

The pressed cheese is really hard, crumbly, matted rennet curd with a
salty ﬂavor and rather open texture. The high salt content, usually 5
percent or more, retards or prevents curing; however, when the cheese is
held it develops a strong ﬂavor and odor and it dries and may be used
as a grating cheese. Some of the skim-milk cheese is smoked for 2 or 3
days, which darkens the surface of the cheese and dries it somewhat in
addition to giving it a smoked ﬂavor.

The cheese is known by many diVerent local names. For example, fresh,
skim-milk, cottage-type cheese is called Queso de Puna in Puerto Rico; and
Queso Fresco (fresh cheese) in El Salvador and Venezuela; also, in
Venezuela, Queso de Llanero, Queso de Maracay, and Queso de Perija,
and other names to denote the place of manufacture.

Fresh cheese made from whole or partly skimmed milk in Mexico is
called Panela.

Cheese made from whole or partly skimmed milk and pressed is called
Queso de Prensa (pressed cheese) in El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, and
Puerto Rico; in Puerto Rico, Queso del Pais or Queso de la Tierra (cheese
of the country, native cheese) ; and in Colombia, Queso Estera (matted
cheese) .

In Costa Rica, cheese made from skim milk and pressed but not cured
is called Queso Descremado (skim-milk cheese) or Queso Huloso (rubber
cheese) ; cheese made from whole milk, heavily salted, pressed, cured for
1 or 2 months, and used as a grating cheese is called Queso de Bagaces;
and cheese made from whole milk, salted and pressed lightly, and cured
for 2 weeks to 2 months is called Queso de Crema (cream cheese).

The cheeses diVer in size. For example, in Panama, Queso Blanco is
pressed in 1-pound molds; in Colombia, Queso Estera ranges in weight
from 5 to 50 pounds; in Costa Rica, Queso Descremado and Queso de

What information is available about Queso de Prensa?,"Queso de Prensa is a hard cheese made in Puerto Rico from cow's whole
milk. The making process diVers in diVerent localities. In one method,
whole milk is put into a vat to ripen at room temperature for about 6 hours,
and rennet is added to coagulate the milk. The curd is broken by hand or
with a curd breaker, part of the whey is removed, and the curd is transferred to a drain table and cut into small pieces. Then it is put into wooden
forms and salt is added, either by mixing it with the curd or by sprinkling
it on top. The curd is covered and pressed lightly. The pressed cheese
is removed from the forms and placed on a rack. It is eaten either while
fresh or after curing for 2 or 3 months. The cheeses are about 11 inches
long, 5/ 2 inches wide, and 3 inches thick, and they weigh about 5 pounds.

In another method, whole or slightly-skimmed milk is put into a vat and
heated to a temperature of 180° F. Acetic acid (diluted with water)
is added, the mixture is stirred until the curd is coagulated, and sodium
bicarbonate is stirred in to neutralize the acid. The curd is transferred
to another container, cut into small pieces, and salted. _Then it is placed
in a circular, tinned metal form, covered with a circular board that ﬁts
over the form, and pressed for a day. It is turned a few times during the
day. The cheeses, which may be eaten either while fresh or after ripening,

What information is available about Ricotta?,"Ricotta cheese is made from the coagulable material (principally albumin) in the whey obtained in the manufacture of other cheeses, such as
Cheddar, Swiss, and Provolone. It was ﬁrst made in Italy and, therefore,
is classed as an Italian cheese. However, it is now made in all the countries
of central Europe and in some parts of southern Europe. It is made also in
the United States, principally in Wisconsin and New York. It is sometimes
called whey cheese or albumin cheese; other names for it are Ziger or
Schottenziger, Recuit, Broccio, Brocotte, Serac, Ceracee, and Mejette.

Cheddar-cheese whey usually contains between 0.2 and 0.35 percent of
fat, and Swiss-cheese whey contains at least twice as much. In making
Ricotta, usually all of the fat is left in the whey, and in the United States

106 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

from 5 to 10 percent of either whole milk or skim milk is added. Usually
whole milk is added if fresh Ricotta is being made, and skim milk if dry
Ricotta is being made. The fat is incorporated in the cheese with the
coagulated albumin, and it improves the body, ﬂavor, and food value of
the cheese.

The manufacturing process should begin soon after the whey is removed
from the original cheese, before it has developed excessive acidity; the
acidity should not be more than 0.20 percent. The sweet whey is heated in
a kettle with a steam jacket to a temperature of 200° F. (near the boiling
point) . Sometimes live steam is injected into the whey. Sour whey or other
coagulant is stirred in. Much of the coagulated albumin rises to the
surface, and is dipped out with a perforated ladle or removed with a dipping
cloth. The curd may be hung in the dipping cloth to cool and drain,
or it may be dipped into perforated forms or spread on a screen platform
in a vat. To improve the ﬂavor and promote ripening, lactic starter may
be mixed in after the curd has cooled to about 100°. From 1 to 1.5 percent
or more of salt may be added at this time.

At this stage the curd is moist, grainy, and lacks cohesiveness; it resembles
cottage-cheese curd in consistency. If it is to be marketed as fresh or moist
Ricotta, draining is continued or the curd may be pressed for several hours

in cheesecloth-lined hoops; then it is packed in paper cartons that usually
hold 5 pounds. If it is to be marketed as dry Ricotta, the curd is placed in
perforated forms about 6 inches in diameter and 9 inches deep, and it is
pressed heavily for a longer period. Then it is salted on the surface, if it
was not salted earlier, and it is dried in a curing room at a temperature of
100° F., or slightly higher. Dry Ricotta is suitable for grating.

Approximately 5 pounds of fresh, moist curd is obtained from 100 pounds
of unskimmed cheese whey with 5 pounds of added whole milk.

Analysis: Fresh, moist Ricotta — Moisture, 68 to 73 percent; fat, 4 to 10

simple. Rennet is added to the milk at a temperature of 90° F., and about
30 minutes later the curd is cut ﬁne and is put into forms with perforated
bottoms. The forms are about 8 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep.
The cheeses are removed from the forms about 5 hours later and are placed

bot:Robbiole, which is similar to Crescenza, is a soft, rich, fast-ripening
cheese made in the Italian Alps, especially in Lombardy. It is circular and
ﬂat and weighs between 8 ounces and 2 pounds. Usually it is made from
milk that is skimmed after creaming for about 12 hours, but sometimes
it is made from whole milk. The method of making Robbiole is very
simple. Rennet is added to the milk at a temperature of 90° F., and about
30 minutes later the curd is cut ﬁne and is put into forms with perforated
bottoms. The forms are about 8 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep.
The cheeses are removed from the forms about 5 hours later and are placed
on straw mats on a drain board; they are turned frequently. After they
have been on the drain board for 2 or 3 days, they are salted on the surface
and are then placed in a cool, moist cellar for 12 to 15 days to ripen.

What information is available about Robbiolini?,"Robbiolini, which is very similar to Crescenza, is a soft cheese made
mostly in Lombardy, Italy, in winter. It is made from cow's milk or from
a mixture of cow's milk and either ewe's or goat's milk. Each cheese
weighs about ounces. About 10 percent of acid whey is added to the
milk, which then is coagulated with rennet at a temperature of 60° F.
After 24 hours the curd is cut into slices, it is drained for 3 or 4 hours, then
kneaded by hand into small rolls. About 3 percent of salt is mixed with
the curd while it is being kneaded. The cheese ripens in a few days; it
should be held at a temperature of not more than 50° until consumed.

Rocamadur

Roeamadur is a soft cheese made from ewe's milk in southern France.
Rennet is added to the milk at a temperature of about 77° F.; when the
curd has coagulated, it is dipped into terra cotta forms and the whey is
drained oV and salt is sifted into the forms. The cheese remains in the
forms for a day. Each cheese weighs about 2 ounces.

What information is available about Romano?,"Romano, which is sometimes called Incanestrato, is one of the most popular of the very hard Italian cheeses. It was ﬁrst made from ewe's milk in
the grazing area of Latium, near Rome, but it is now made also from cow's
and goat's milk and in other regions in southern Italy and in Sardinia.
When made from ewe's milk, it is called Pecorino Romano; from cow's
milk, Vacchino Romano; and from goat's milk, Caprino Romano. Romano-type cheese made in Sardinia is called Sardo. Some Romano cheese
is made in the United States from cow's milk, and considerable quantities
are imported from Italy and Sardinia.

The cheeses are round, with ﬁat ends; they vary in size but frequently

weighs between 15 and 20 pounds but may weigh as much as 25 pounds.
The interior is somewhat granular and has practically no holes or eyes.

What information is available about Roquefort?,"Roquefort, a blue-veined, semisoft to hard cheese, is named for the
village of Roquefort in the Department of Aveyron in southeastern France,
where its manufacture has been an important industry for more than two
centuries. At one time shepherds prepared the curd, but now the milk is
collected and the curd is prepared in centralized dairies.

110 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

A French regulation limits use of the word Roquefort to cheese made
in the Roquefort area from ewe's milk. Other French cheese of the

Roquefort type is called Bleu cheese, and Roquefort- type cheese made in
the United States and other countries is known as Blue cheese. In addition, there are the distinctive blue-veined cheeses of England (Stilton)
and Italy (Gorgonzola) . (See Bleu, Blue, Stilton, and Gorgonzola.)

Roquefort cheese is characterized by its sharp, peppery, piquant ﬂavor,
and by the mottled, blue-green veins throughout the curd and the whiteness of the curd between the veins. Powder containing spores of Penicillium
roqueforti mold is added to the curd as it is being put into the hoops, and
the veins result from growth of the mold during the curing period. The
powder is prepared by inocculating loaves of fresh bread with a pure culture
of mold; when the mold has permeated the bread — in 4 to 6 weeks — the
interior is crumbled,, dried, ground,, sifted,, and stored for use in the cheese.

Following is a brief description of the making process: Ewe's whole
milk is set with rennet at a temperature between 76° and 82° F. It is
customary to heat fresh milk to between 122° and 140° and then to add
enough cold milk to adjust the mixture to the setting temperature. After
a coagulation period of lj^ to 2 hours, the curd is cut, the free whey is
removed, and the curd either is transferred onto a cloth to drain or is
mixed and drained in the vat. Then it is transferred to perforated metal
hoops, about 7^4 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep, which rest on
drain mats on drain boards. The curd is put into the hoops in 3 or 4
layers, and blue-mold powder is sprinkled between each layer.

The curd is not pressed, but the hoops are turned several times the
ﬁrst day, and two or three times daily for the next 4 or 5 days. Then the
cheeses are removed from the hoops, and they are taken to the caves for

salting and curing. There are many natural caves in the Roquefort area
and additional excavations have been made. The caves are a network of
caverns and grottoes connected with one another and with the outside
surface by numerous channels through which a brisk movement of cool,
moist air keeps the temperature at not more than 50° F. (often as low as
40°) and the relative humidity at about 95 percent throughout the year,
thus providing natural conditions that are favorable to mold growth arid
ripening of Roquefort cheese.

The cheeses are dry salted, piled in two or three layers for 3 days, then
salted again and piled in layers for another 3 or 4 days — making a total
salting period of a week. Besides improving the ﬂavor, the rather heavy
salting retards growth of slime-forming micro-organisms and foreign molds
and is one of the factors that control normal ripening. When salting is
completed, each cheese is punched with 60 or more holes, which permit air
to reach the interior of the cheese so that the blue mold can grow. The
cheeses are then placed on edge on racks, and they are cleaned every 2 or
3 weeks by scraping and brushing. The curing period is 2 to 5 months,
depending on the extent of ripening desired. When ripened suViciently,
the cheeses are cleaned, wrapped in tinfoil, and boxed. They may be
stored at a temperature of 40° F. The yield of cured cheese is said to be;
nearly 20 percent of the weight of milk used.","human:What information is available about Roquefort?

What information is available about Sandwich Nut cheese is made by mixing chopped nuts with fresh Neufchatel or Cream cheese.?,"Sapsago

Sapsago cheese has been made in the Canton of Glarus, Switzerland, for
at least 500 years and perhaps more; it is made also in Germany. It is
known by various other names, including Schabziger, Glarnerkase, Griinerkase, Krauterkase, and Griinerkrauterkase. It is a small, very hard cheese
and frequently it is dried. A powder prepared from clover leaves is added
to the curd, which gives it a sharp, pungent ﬂavor and a pleasing aroma and
a light-green or sage-green color. The cured cheeses are cone-shaped, 3
inches thick at the base, 2 inches at the top, and 4 inches tall, and they
weigh 1 to 254 pounds. The fully cured, dry cheese can be used for grating.

Sapsago is made from slightly sour, skim milk. The milk is put into a
round kettle and stirred while it is heated to boiling temperature. Cold
buttermilk is added slowly as heating and stirring are continued. The coagulum that appears on the surface is removed, set aside, and added to the
curd when it is put into the forms. Then enough sour whey is added to
precipitate the casein, as in making Ricotta, and stirring is stopped. If too
little whey is added, the curd will be too soft and moist; if too much or too
sour whey is added, the curd will be too ﬁrm and dry. The curd is collected
in a cloth or strainer and spread out to cool as the whey is drained oV. Then
the coagulum that was set aside is mixed with the curd, salt may be added,
and it is placed in perforated wooden forms, covered with a press lid, and

pressed under heavy pressure at a temperature of 60° F. The curd is ripened
(cured) under light pressure at this temperature for at least 5 weeks. At
this stage, it is ready for use in making the cheese. In many cases it is
sold and transported in large sacks or casks to a distant factory where the
cheese is made.

The ripe, dry curd is ground, and about 5 pounds of salt and 2/2 pounds
of dried, powdered leaves of the aromatic clover, Melilotus coerulea, are
added to each 100 pounds of curd. The mixture is stirred into a homogeneous paste, then packed in the small cloth-lined, cone-shaped forms.

About 10 or 11 pounds of fresh curd is obtained per 100 pounds of skim
milk and about 65 pounds of Sapsago is obtained per 100 pounds of fresh
curd.

Analysis: Moisture, as much as 40 to 43 percent but usually much less
(cheese imported into the United States, not more than 38 percent) ; fat, 5 to
9.4 percent; protein, 40 to 42.5 percent; and salt, 4 to 5 percent.

What information is available about The method of making is not uniform in the diVerent factories and con-?,"sequently the cheese is not a uniform product. However, the method is
in general as follows :

Usually whole milk is used, but sometimes the milk is partly skimmed.
The milk is put in a round kettle and warmed to a temperature of about
85° F. Rennet is added and after a coagulation period of about 30 minutes
the curd is cut and stirred with a scoop. Then it is heated gradually to a
temperature of 130° to 135° and cutting and stirring are continued until

What information is available about Stilton?,"Stilton, considered by many people to be the ﬁnest English cheese, is a
hard, mild, blue-veined, cow's-milk cheese. It was ﬁrst made about 1750
in Leicestershire but acquired its name and excellent reputation when it
was made and served at Stilton, in Huntingdonshire. It is now made
also in other parts of England. Attempts to make high-quality cheese of
this type in the United States have not been successful.

Stilton, which is one of the mold-ripened group of blue-veined cheeses
that includes French Roquefort and Italian Gorgonzola, is rich and mellow
and has a piquant ﬂavor; however, it is milder than either Roquefort or
Gorgonzola. Its distinguishing characteristics are the narrow blue-green
veins of mold throughout the curd and the wrinkled, melon-like rind that
results from the drying of molds and bacteria that grow on the surface.
The open and ﬂaky texture of the curd in Stilton cheese provides conditions
suitable for mold growth, so holes are not usually punched in the cheese

as in Roquefort and Gorgonzola. At one time the desirable open, ﬂaky
texture was obtained by preparing curd in the evening and in the morning
and mixing the two curds together. Some dairies still make the cheese
twice a day, but the curds are not mixed.

The cheeses usually measure about 8 inches in diameter and from 8 to
12 inches thick, and they weigh from 12 to 15 pounds. However, in some

122 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

localities, smaller cheeses weighing about 10 pounds and also larger cheeses
weighing 16 to 18 pounds are made.

Originally cream was added to the whole milk used in making Stilton,
usually cream from one milking being added to whole milk of the next.
However, it is now common practice to make ""single-cream"" Stilton rather
than the so-called ""double-cream"" type. Usually the milk is ripened
slightly; if not, a small quantity of lactic starter is added. The temperature
in the manufacturing room is maintained at about 65° to 68° F. The milk
is warmed to about 85° and enough rennet is added so the curd will be ﬁrm
enough to dip in about 80 minutes.

The curd is broken carefully, and about 10 minutes later it is dipped in
thin slices into cloth-lined draining tins where it remains in the whey for

about an hour and a half. Then the whey is drained oV, and the cloths
are tightened frequently around the curd to aid in draining the whey more
completely. Sometimes the curd is removed from the cloths and cut into
cubes, and the cubes are turned frequently as the curd develops the desired
acidity and ﬁrmness. When the curd has drained and matted suViciently,
it is broken into coarse pieces and salted at the rate of 1 pound to 60 pounds
of curd. Then it is put into tinned, perforated metal hoops, 8 inches in
diameter and 10 inches or more deep. The hoops of cheese rest on clothcovered drain boards and are turned frequently the ﬁrst day and then daily
for 6 or 7 days. Then the cheeses are removed from the hoops, scraped to
smooth the surface, bandaged tightly, and they may be replaced in the hoops.
This process is repeated one or more times, until the cheeses are suViciently
ﬁrm, at which time the bandaged cheeses are moved to a cool, ventilated
room. They are kept in this room until a moldy coating forms on the
surface, usually about 2 weeks; then the bandages are removed and the
cheeses are transferred to clean shelves in a cool, moist curing room. The
mold, said to be Penicillium roqueforti, gradually develops in the curd. The
cheeses are kept clean and are turned frequently. The usual curing period
is 4 to 6 months, but the cheeses may be wrapped and shipped earlier.

for 6 or 7 days. Then the cheeses are removed from the hoops, scraped to
smooth the surface, bandaged tightly, and they may be replaced in the hoops.
This process is repeated one or more times, until the cheeses are suViciently
ﬁrm, at which time the bandaged cheeses are moved to a cool, ventilated
room. They are kept in this room until a moldy coating forms on the
surface, usually about 2 weeks; then the bandages are removed and the
cheeses are transferred to clean shelves in a cool, moist curing room. The
mold, said to be Penicillium roqueforti, gradually develops in the curd. The
cheeses are kept clean and are turned frequently. The usual curing period
is 4 to 6 months, but the cheeses may be wrapped and shipped earlier.

Swiss (Emmentaler) cheese, which is a large, hard, pressed-curd cheese
with an elastic body and a mild, nut-like, sweetish ﬂavor, is best known
because of the holes or eyes that develop in the curd as the cheese ripens.
The eyes often are / 2 to 1 inch in diameter and from 1 to 3 inches apart.
The cheeses are about 6 inches thick, frequently more than 36 inches in
diameter, and usually weigh between 160 and 230 pounds.

Switzerland is famous for this so-called King of Cheeses, and a large part
of the milk produced in Switzerland is used in its production. It was ﬁrst
made, probably about the middle of the 15th century, in the Canton of
Bern in the Emmental Valley (which accounts for its native name Emmentaler) . The industry was well developed and cheese was being exported
by the middle of the 17th century. Only the best cheese is exported, and
it is commonly called ""Switzerland Swiss.""

Swiss cheese is made in many other countries besides Switzerland, including France, Denmark, Germany, Bavaria, Italy, Austria, Finland, Russia,
Argentina, and the United States. Allgauer Emmentaler, Bellunese,
Formaggio Dolce, Fontina, Fontine d'Aosta, and Traanen are local names
for similar cheeses made in Switzerland and nearby countries. Gruyere,
made mostly in France, is similar to Swiss but is smaller and cures somewhat diVerently. Danish Swiss is called Samso.

The ﬁrst Swiss cheese in the United States was made about 1850 by
Swiss immigrants, and much of it is still being made by their descendants.
Among the hard cheeses, Swiss ranks second only to Cheddar in the quantity

produced each year. About half of the annual production of 100 million
pounds is made in Wisconsin, and Illinois, Idaho, Minnesota, Ohio, Utah,
and Wyoming are other leading producers. In the United States it is
often called Schweizer or Sweitzer.

Although there are slight diVerences between the methods used for making
Swiss cheese in Switzerland and in the United States, following is a brief
description of the general method :

Swiss cheese is made in round copper kettles that hold at least 2,000
pounds of milk, and frequently 3,000 or 3,200 pounds. The kettles are
double-jacketed or have a steam chamber in the bottom. Good-quality,
fresh milk is essential. It is advisable to clarify and standardize the milk.
Clariﬁcation increases the elasticity of the curd in the cheese and improves
eye formation. Standardizing the fat content of the milk assures cheese
of uniform composition; usually slightly more than 10 percent of the fat is
removed.

As the milk ﬂows from the clariﬁer into the kettle, steam is turned on
in the jacket or steam chamber under the kettle, and the milk is warmed
to setting temperature ' (88° to 94° F.). Stirring is begun, the starter is
added, and shortly thereafter enough rennet extract is added so the curd
will be ﬁrm enough to cut in 30 minutes (the ﬁrst indication of thickening
appears in from 20 to 22 minutes) .

As soon as the curd is ﬁrm enough to cut, the surface is ""turned under"" —
that is, the creamy top layer is skimmed oV with a wide, ﬂat scoop and
pushed to the back of the kettle, in order to mix this creamy layer with the
rest of the curd. The curd is cut with a Swiss-cheese harp— from back to
front and from side to side— into long rectangular strips about 1 inch square.
Then the curd is turned under from top to bottom with a scoop, so that

which was underneath will be on the surface, and the pieces are cut into
1-inch cubes. About 5 minutes after cutting is completed, the curd is
harped (cut and mixed) until the particles are about % inch in diameter.
This usually requires about 15 minutes.

Then the curd is ""foreworked""— that is, stirred slowly, either continuously or at intervals — for 30 minutes to an hour or more as it acquires ﬁrmness. When it is suViciently ﬁrm, steam is turned on and the curd is heated,
usually in 30 minutes, to a temperature between 120° and 127.5° F. It is
stirred continuously while it is being heated, and stirring is continued for
at least 25 minutes and sometimes for an hour or longer after the ﬁnal
cooking temperature is reached. This is called ""stirring out."" As soon
as the particles of curd can be broken apart easily without sticking when
compressed in the hand, the curd is ready to be dipped. Some cheesemakers add several gallons of cold water at this point. Stirring is discontinued, so the curd will settle, and some of the whey is drawn oV.

The curd is enclosed in a large, coarsely woven dipping cloth, and it is
hoisted slowly over the kettle with a block and tackle, and the excess whey
drains into the kettle. The bag of curd is then lowered into a circular
wooden or stainless-steel hoop, which rests on a circular pressboard on a
drain table. The curd is pressed gently down into the hoop, the edges of
the cloth are smoothed over the curd, a circular pressboard is laid on top
of the curd, and the curd is pressed from above with a screw- or lever-press.

About 5 minutes -later, the hoop is removed; a clean, light cloth and a
clean, heavy burlap cloth are substituted for the dipping cloth; the hoop

126 AGRICULTURE HANDBOOK, U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE

is replaced; the cheese is turned over and another pressboard is placed on
it ; and it is pressed again. This process is repeated at deﬁnite intervals for
24 hours.

Then the cheese is removed from the press and, still in the hoop, it is
taken to the so-called cold room (temperature about 55° F. and relative
humidity 80 to 85 percent) , where it is salted in brine. The cheese may be
removed from the hoop and placed in the salt tank at once; or, still in the
hoop, it may be placed on a shelf to cool for a day or so before it is salted.
It is left in the salt brine for 2 or 3 days, the time depending on the size of the
cheese, the amount of salt absorbed, and the rind formation desired. It is
turned over and sprinkled with salt daily. Then it is placed on a circular
board on a shelf in the cold room for a week or 10 days; it is washed,
turned, and sprinkled with dry salt daily.

Then it is transferred to a clean board on a shelf in the warm room
(temperature 65° to 72° F. and relative humidity 80 to 85 percent), where
the principal ripening process takes place. The cheese is washed with
salty water, it is turned and placed on a clean board, and salt is rubbed on
the surface every few days. The eyes begin to form when the cheese is about
3 weeks old; eye formation is controlled to some extent by regulating the
temperature of the room. The cheese usually remains in the warm room
for 4 to 6 weeks; then it is returned to the cold room for further but slower
curing, or to a storage room where it is held at about 40° .

Much of the cheese made in the United States is marketed after curing
for 3 or 4 months (the minimum curing period is 2 months) . Most of the
cheese exported from Switzerland is cured for 6 to 10 months and has a
more pronounced ﬂavor.

A cheese weighing between 185 and 210 pounds can be made from a
2,500-pound kettle of milk. Several cheeses are packed in a round, wooden
box for shipment; the box may contain more than 1,000 pounds of cheese.
Swiss cheese is also made in rectangular blocks, about 28 inches long and
8 inches square, that weigh 25 to 28 pounds.

So-called rindless Swiss cheese is made by a somewhat modiﬁed method.
The milk (in some instances as much as 10,000 pounds) is set in a rectangular vat, and the curd is prepared in the usual way. The curd and whey
are transferred to a so-called press vat. Then, in a procedure similar to that
used in making Herrgirdsost, the curd is pressed under the whey into a
ﬂat, rectangular block. The block of curd is subdivided into sections, each
of which makes a cheese. Each cheese is placed in a cloth-lined box and
pressed, then removed from the box, salted in brine, and dried. Then it
is wrapped in ﬁlm and placed in a box to cure.

slovakia, southern Germany, and other parts of Europe. It is much the
same as the Port du Salut cheese made in France and the Oka cheese made
in Canada, but there are variations in the manufacturing process.

The cheese is pale yellow and has a mild ﬂavor. Although it is a semisoft
cheese, it is cured more like the hard cheeses. It is washed frequently
during the curing period, which largely prevents the growth of mold on the
surface, and it ripens throughout rather than only from the surface. The
size varies, the smallest being about 7 inches in diameter and weighing
2^2 to 3 pounds. A larger size is about 10 inches in diameter and weighs
about 5 pounds — the usual size of Port du Salut. There are still larger
sizes, weighing about 10 pounds or more.

Trappist cheese is made from fresh, whole milk, usually cow's milk but
some ewe's or goat's milk may be added. The milk is set with rennet at a
temperature of about 82° to 90° F. After a coagulation period of 30 to 40
minutes (or as long as 90 when the setting temperature is low) the curd
is cut, stirred, and heated, in some instances to a temperature of 95° to 108°.
The whey is removed and the curd is transferred to forms. In Bosnia, the
curd is pressed lightly, and the cheese is rather soft and tender. In Hungary
and Czechoslovakia, the curd is pressed more heavily, and the cheese is
somewhat ﬁrmer. The ripening period is from 5 to 6 weeks. The cheese
is cured initially in a humid room at a temperature of 62° to 68° and later
in a cooler cellar. The yield is 9 to 1 1 pounds of cheese per 100 pounds of
cow's milk.

Analysis: Moisture, 45.9 percent; fat, 26.1 percent; protein, 23.3 percent;

cheese that is made in the same way as Cheddar except that the milled

absorbed by the curd during this process. Then the curd is drained,

Washing the curd increases the moisture content of the cheese, reduces
the lactose content and ﬁnal acidity, decreases body ﬁrmness, and increases openness of texture. Washed-curd cheese does not keep as well

milk, and fresh whole milk. Most of the cheese marketed is Zweizeitige;
Dreizeitige and Herbst are consumed locally.

The milk is mixed in a copper kettle and curdled with rennet at a
temperature of 82° to 86° F. After a coagulation period of 25 to 30 minutes, the curd is cut and stirred with a large scoop or ladle for 25 to 35
minutes. Some of the whey is removed, and the soft curd is transferred
to a large curd-drying box that holds enough curd for 3 to 5 cheeses. The
box is perforated and has a grating in the bottom and is lined with cloth.
The curd is mixed and squeezed in the box until it is rather ﬁrm; then the
grating is removed, 2 or 3 percent of salt is mixed with the curd, and it is
kneaded by hand. The curd is transferred to cylindrical, perforated, clothlined forms similar to those used in making Tilsiter. Each form holds

between 9 and 1 1 pounds of curd. The cheese is pressed heavily for 8 to 12
hours; then it is removed from the forms. It is soft at this stage and tends
to ﬂatten. If necessary to control ﬂattening, it is bandaged, and it is turned
daily. After 10 or 12 days, it is transferred to a dry room, and it may be
enclosed in a bladder or membrane to protect the surface. The cheese is
marketed when it is 3 to 4 weeks old. From 9/ 2 to 12 pounds of cured
cheese is obtained from 100 pounds of milk, depending on the fat content
of the milk from which the cheese is made.","human:What information is available about Wilstermarsch?
bot:Wilstermarsch, or Holsteiner Marsch, cheese is made from cow's milk
in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is similar to Tilsiter in many respects ;
however, it is made by a considerably diVerent process and is cured for a
shorter period. It has a mildy acid ﬂavor and ripens rapidly; in fact, it is
often marketed before it has reached the most desirable stage of ripeness.

There are ﬁve types of Wilstermarsch, as follows : ( 1 ) Rahm, which is
made from fresh, whole milk with cream added; (2) Sussmilch, which is
made from fresh, whole milk; (3) Zweizeitige, which is made from a mixture of evening skim milk and morning whole milk; (4) Dreizeitige, which
is made from a mixture of 24-hour-old skim milk, 12-hour-old skim milk,
and fresh whole milk; and (5) Herbst, which is made from a mixture of
36- to 48-hour-old skim milk, 24-hour-old skim milk, 12-hour-old skim

What information is available about Wiltshire?,"Wiltshire, which was ﬁrst made in western Wiltshire, England, is a hard,
sweet-curd cheese similar to Derby. One style, which is about 9 inches
in diameter and 9 inches thick, is known as Truckles.

Morning milk is added to partly skimmed evening milk, which has been
kept cool overnight. The temperature of the milk is adjusted to 80° F.,
and rennet is added. An hour later the curd is cut with a curd breaker or
curd knives. It is warmed, with gentle stirring, to 90°. When it is suViciently ﬁrm, it is removed from the whey, pressed for about 20 minutes,
ground in a curd mill, and. sal ted at the rate of about pounds of salt
per 100 pounds of curd. The curd is pressed overnight in a so-called press
vat, which is a wooden form with holes in the bottom to permit drainage
of the whey. The following day the cheese is removed from the press,
salted on the surface, dressed in cloth, and repressed. This process is
repeated once or twice, after which the cheese is pressed continuously for
a week. Then it is transferred to the curing room where it is placed on
boards. If necessary, the cheeses are bandaged at ﬁrst to aid in retaining
their shape, and they may be inverted during curing by means of a revolving
rack. The cheese is cured in the same way as Derby cheese. (See Derby.)

that used in making Acidophilus cheese contains S. thermophilus and Th.
acidophilum. The starter produces considerable acid in the cheese, which

gives it a sharp ﬂavor. Except for the use of the distinctive starters, these
cheeses are made in much the same way as either the soft cheeses, such as
Cream, Brie, Coulommiers, and Camembert, or the hard cheeses, such as
Gouda. The milk is pasteurized to eliminate undesirable micro-organisms.
Usually a soft, moist curd is prepared, molded in forms, and consumed while
it is fresh. In some instances, the curd is pressed in the forms to make a
ﬁrmer cheese. Sometimes the cheese is ripened with Camembert mold to
make Yoghurt- or Acidophilus-Camembert cheese. If the cheese is ripened,
the curd must be well drained.

These cheeses are made mostly in the Mediterranean countries, noted
for their use of fermented milks. Yoghurt cheese was ﬁrst made in Bulgaria
from ewe's milk; it is made. also in Quebec, Canada, from cow's milk.

In Bulgaria, about 3 percent of Yoghurt starter is added to the pasteurized
milk, and it is coagulated with rennet at a temperature of 107° F. After a
coagulation period of about 4 hours, the curd is cut, the whey is drained
oV, and the curd is molded in forms in much the same way as in making
Cream cheese.

In Quebec, pasteurized whole milk is coagulated with a Yoghurt starter,
the curd is drained in bags, salted, and worked, then packaged in cartons.
The cheese has a sharply acid ﬂavor, the consistency of ﬁne-grained Cottage
cheese, and good keeping quality for a very soft cheese.

Analysis: Bulgarian method — Moisture, 40 to 50 percent; fat, 25 to 33
percent; and protein, 17 to 21 percent. Quebec method — Moisture, 50 to

95° F., and enough rennet is added to coagulate it in about 30 minutes.
The curd is broken up with a harp, loosened from the bottom of the vat,
and then left undisturbed for about 30 minutes while the curd mats. The
matted curd is cut into pieces and stirred gently for a considerable period.
Then, for another 15 minutes, the curd is again left undisturbed while it
settles. Then the whey is dipped oV, and the curd is dipped into cheesecloth-lined forms, 24 inches long and 5 inches wide, each of which holds
the curd obtained from 7}4 to 8 gallons of milk. The forms of curd are
turned frequently as the whey drains for a day. Then the curd is cut into
smaller portions, each of which is placed in a small form that rests on a
board. The forms of curd are turned and the board is replaced with a
clean one daily for 8 days. Then the cheeses are removed from the forms,
salt is rubbed on the surface, and they are washed in salty water and rubbed
by hand every day for at least a month. They are ready for market in
2 months.
