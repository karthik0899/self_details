## 1. System Overview

This system provides an advanced inference API for generating optimized abstracts and titles for research papers. It uses a combination of FastAPI for the web framework, custom model inference, and dynamic prompt generation to produce high-quality results based on user input.

## 2. Components

### 2.1 Advanced Inference Endpoint

The Advanced Inference Endpoint is responsible for handling incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate generation handler.

File: `advanced_inference_endpoint.py`

Key Features:
- Implements a FastAPI router for the `/advancedinference` endpoint
- Validates input data
- Calls the model generation function with the provided input

### 2.2 Advanced Generation Handler

The Advanced Generation Handler manages the process of generating optimized abstracts and titles based on the input data.

File: `advgenerationhandler.py`

Key Features:
- Handles different types of generation (titles and abstracts)
- Interacts with the model inference module
- Processes and formats the generated output

### 2.3 Prompt Generator

The Prompt Generator is responsible for creating dynamic prompts based on the input data and generation type.

File: `promptgenerator.py`

Key Features:
- Generates prompts for different types of content (technical and creative)
- Incorporates user-provided data into the prompts
- Ensures prompts follow specific guidelines and constraints

## 3. API Documentation

### POST /advancedinference/model_generation

Generates optimized abstracts or titles based on the provided input.

Request Body:
```json
{
  "indata": {
    "typeofgeneration": "string",
    "methodofgeneration": "string",
    "data": {
      "abstract": "string",
      "conclusion": "string"
    },
    "key_words": ["string"],
    "audience_purpose": "string",
    "confidence": "number"
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "generated_titles": ["string"] | null,
  "optimized_abstract": "string" | null,
  "raw_output": "string",
  "error": "string" | null
}
```

## 4. Configuration and Environment

This section would typically include information about configuration options and environment variables. However, the provided code snippets do not contain explicit configuration or environment variable usage. If there are any configuration requirements, they should be documented here.

## 5. Workflow

1. The client sends a POST request to `/advancedinference/model_generation` with the required input data.
2. The Advanced Inference Endpoint validates the input and passes it to the model generation function.
3. The Advanced Generation Handler determines the type of generation required and calls the appropriate functions.
4. The Prompt Generator creates a dynamic prompt based on the input data and generation type.
5. The model inference is performed using the generated prompt.
6. The output is processed and returned to the client.

## 6. Function-Level Documentation

### Advanced Inference Endpoint

#### `advancedinference(jsonpackage: Dict[str, Any])`

Handles the POST request for model generation.

Parameters:
- `jsonpackage`: A dictionary containing the input data for generation.

Returns:
- A dictionary containing the generated content or error message.

Raises:
- `HTTPException`: If the abstract is missing or invalid.

Usage example:
```python
result = advancedinference({
    "indata": {
        "typeofgeneration": "titles",
        "methodofgeneration": "technical",
        "data": {
            "abstract": "Sample abstract text",
            "conclusion": "Sample conclusion text"
        },
        "key_words": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
        "audience_purpose": "Academic researchers",
        "confidence": 0.8
    }
})
```

### Advanced Generation Handler

#### `model_generation(datadict: Dict[str, Any])`

Manages the generation process based on the input data.

Parameters:
- `datadict`: A dictionary containing the input data and generation parameters.

Returns:
- A dictionary containing the generated content or error message.

Usage example:
```python
result = model_generation({
    "indata": {
        "typeofgeneration": "abstract",
        "methodofgeneration": "creative",
        "data": {
            "abstract": "Original abstract text",
            "conclusion": "Conclusion text"
        },
        "key_words": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
        "audience_purpose": "General public",
        "confidence": 0.7
    }
})
```

#### `extract_abstract(text: str)`

Extracts the optimized abstract from the generated text.

Parameters:
- `text`: The raw generated text containing the optimized abstract.

Returns:
- The extracted optimized abstract as a string.

### Prompt Generator

#### `dynamic_prompt_generation(new_dict: Dict[str, Any])`

Generates a dynamic prompt based on the input data and generation type.

Parameters:
- `new_dict`: A dictionary containing the input data and generation parameters.

Returns:
- A string containing the generated prompt.

Raises:
- `KeyError`: If required data is missing from the input dictionary.

Usage example:
```python
prompt = dynamic_prompt_generation({
    "indata": {
        "typeofgeneration": "titles",
        "methodofgeneration": "creative",
        "data": {
            "abstract": "Sample abstract",
            "conclusion": "Sample conclusion"
        },
        "key_words": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
        "audience_purpose": "Industry professionals"
    }
})
```

## 7. Troubleshooting and FAQs

Q: What should I do if I receive a 400 error when calling the API?
A: Ensure that you've provided a valid abstract in your request. The abstract should not be empty and should contain alphabetic characters.

Q: How can I control the creativity level of the generated content?
A: Use the `methodofgeneration` parameter in your request. Set it to "technical" for more precise, technical output, or "creative" for more imaginative results.

Q: What's the maximum number of titles that can be generated?
A: The system currently generates up to 5 titles per request.

## 8. Maintenance and Contribution
